## Welcome to the Cyber Defence Kit

### Introduction

The **Cyber Defence Kit (CDK)** began as a personal exploration of open-source cybersecurity tools and gradually evolved into a shared learning resource.

Each step of the journey was documented through proof-of-concept videos, notes, lessons learned, and practical tips, all shared openly to make these tools more accessible. The goal is to encourage others to explore, implement, and truly understand open-source cybersecurity solutions through hands-on practice.

This documentation serves as a central reference for how the Cyber Defence Kit is built, tested, and used in real-world style lab environments.

## Getting started

To begin leveraging the Cyber Defence Kit:

### Understand the toolkit
Familiarise yourself with the components of the kit and how they fit together. The documentation is structured to help you understand not just *what* each tool does, but *why* it exists in the overall design.

### Set up your environment
Prepare your system by reviewing the hardware and software requirements before installation.  
This includes planning for different deployment scenarios, such as:

- Standard lab environments  
- Resource-constrained systems  
- Air-gapped or offline environments  

### Learn and explore
Work through the documentation and proof-of-concept material to explore attack simulation, detection, and response workflows. The focus is on learning by doing, experimenting safely, and understanding the trade-offs involved.

## Important notes

- **Security first**  
  Always follow security best practices when installing, configuring, and operating tools within the Cyber Defence Kit.

- **Air-gapped environments**  
  Special considerations are required for installations without internet access. These are documented where relevant, including offline dependencies and update strategies.

- **Legal compliance**  
  Ensure all activities carried out using this kit comply with applicable laws, policies, and regulatory requirements. The Cyber Defence Kit is intended strictly for defensive learning and research purposes.
