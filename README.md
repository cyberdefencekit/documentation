## Features

- **Clear Structure**: Organised sections for easy navigation and understanding.
- **Searchable**: Quickly find the information you need.
- **Customisable**: Built with MkDocs Material, allowing for future enhancements and theming.

5. Open your browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

### Installation Notes

If the `mkdocs` command is not available after installing `mkdocs-material`, itâ€™s likely due to the following reasons:

1. The `mkdocs` executable is installed in the user's local `~/.local/bin/` directory, which may not be included in your system's `PATH` environment variable.
2. Without the correct `PATH` configuration, the terminal cannot locate the `mkdocs` executable.

To resolve this, you can either:

- Add `~/.local/bin/` to your `PATH`:
    
    ```bash
    echo 'export PATH=$PATH:~/.local/bin' >> ~/.bashrc
    source ~/.bashrc
    ```
    
- Install `mkdocs` system-wide using your package manager:
    
    ```bash
    sudo apt install mkdocs
    ```
