# Splunk

Splunk Enterprise is a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tool usually installed on the server. It is designed for searching, analysing, and visualising data. It allows users to collect and ingest data, and search across various data types. Splunk Universal Forwarders are usually installed on clients to provide reliable, secure data collection and forward that data into Splunk Enterprise for indexing. This part of documentation focuses on installing and configuring Splunk. For Splunk, the main focus will be installing Splunk Enterprise and Universal Forwarder.

## Lab Setup for Proof of Concept

A virtual lab in an Unclassified environment is used as a proof of concept. Internet access was disabled during the installation to simulate an air-gapped environment. For a testing purpose, a free trial version was used for Splunk Enterprise and Universal Forwarder. Attack emulation was conducted on a FortiGate VM in a safe and controlled setting. 

**Note: Do not attempt to replicate the attack emulation demonstrated here unless you are properly trained and it is safe to do so. Unauthorised attack emulation can lead to legal consequences and unintended damage to systems. Always ensure that such activities are conducted by qualified professionals in a secure, isolated environment.**

```

## **Install and Configure Splunk Enterprise**

Splunk Enterprise enables you to search, analyze and visualise your data to quickly act on insights from across your technology landscape. This step focuses on installing and configuring Splunk Enterprise. 

Note: Linux, 4.X, 5.10, 5.14,5.15 and 5.4.X kernels are ideal so Ubuntu 20.04 LTS or CentOS Stream 9 are recommended. As internet is required to register the system, RHEL is not recommended in an air-gapped environment. 

Download [Splunk Enterprise](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/download/splunk-enterprise.html) for Linux (.tgz).

Untar (unzip) the tar archive to /opt directory

```bash
sudo tar xvzf splunk-9.3.1-0b8d769cb912-Linux-x86_64.tgz -C /opt
```

Create user splunk and change ownership of /opt/splunk directory to the splunk user 

On CentOS, after adding user, go to settings > Users. Unlock to Change Settings. Set password for the `splunk` user

On Ubuntu, enter password and user information for the `splunk` user (use default values by pressing `enter` ). 

```python
sudo adduser splunk
```

Make the splunk user the owner of the splunk directory. Change permissions and verify the ownership.

```bash
sudo chown -R splunk:splunk /opt/splunk
cd /opt
ls -la
```

```python
#Example output
total 12
drwxr-xr-x  3 root   root   4096 Sep 18 15:36 .
drwxr-xr-x 20 root   root   4096 Sep 18 15:21 ..
drwxr-xr-x 11 **splunk splunk** 4096 Sep  6 05:58 splunk
```

Switch to splunk user and start splunk. When prompted, create admin credentials.

```bash
**su splunk**
cd splunk/bin
./splunk start --accept-license
```

Wait for webser at `http://127.0.0.1:8000` to be available. Navigate to `http://<IP address>:8000`or `http://localhost:8000` on web browser.  

Enter in splunk admin credentials you created when installing Splunk Enterprise

Setup Splunk to listen on port 9997

```bash
# in /opt/splunk/bin/
./splunk enable listen 9997
```

Alternatively this can be done on the web UI

Settings > Forwarding and Receiving > Add new under Receive Data > Listen on this port: 9997 > Save > Verify the listen on port 9997 is enabled under Receive Data and Configure receiving

## Ingesting FortiGate Logs through SC4S (Option 1)

SC4S is an open source packaged solution for getting data into Splunk. It is based on the syslog-ng Open Source Edition (Syslog-NG OSE) and transports data to Splunk via the Splunk HTTP event Collector (HEC) rather than writing events to disk for collection by a Universal Forwarder.

### Create indexes for SC4S

Copy indexes.conf from here:

```python
[default]
lastChanceIndex = main

[email]
homePath   = $SPLUNK_DB/email/db
coldPath   = $SPLUNK_DB/email/colddb
thawedPath = $SPLUNK_DB/email/thaweddb

[epav]
homePath   = $SPLUNK_DB/epav/db
coldPath   = $SPLUNK_DB/epav/colddb
thawedPath = $SPLUNK_DB/epav/thaweddb

[epintel]
homePath   = $SPLUNK_DB/epintel/db
coldPath   = $SPLUNK_DB/epintel/colddb
thawedPath = $SPLUNK_DB/epintel/thaweddb

[fireeye]
homePath   = $SPLUNK_DB/fireeye/db
coldPath   = $SPLUNK_DB/fireeye/colddb
thawedPath = $SPLUNK_DB/fireeye/thaweddb

[gitops]
homePath   = $SPLUNK_DB/gitops/db
coldPath   = $SPLUNK_DB/gitops/colddb
thawedPath = $SPLUNK_DB/gitops/thaweddb

[infraops]
homePath   = $SPLUNK_DB/infraops/db
coldPath   = $SPLUNK_DB/infraops/colddb
thawedPath = $SPLUNK_DB/infraops/thaweddb

[netauth]
homePath   = $SPLUNK_DB/netauth/db
coldPath   = $SPLUNK_DB/netauth/colddb
thawedPath = $SPLUNK_DB/netauth/thaweddb

[netdlp]
homePath   = $SPLUNK_DB/netdlp/db
coldPath   = $SPLUNK_DB/netdlp/colddb
thawedPath = $SPLUNK_DB/netdlp/thaweddb

[netdns]
homePath   = $SPLUNK_DB/netdns/db
coldPath   = $SPLUNK_DB/netdns/colddb
thawedPath = $SPLUNK_DB/netdns/thaweddb

[netfw]
homePath   = $SPLUNK_DB/netfw/db
coldPath   = $SPLUNK_DB/netfw/colddb
thawedPath = $SPLUNK_DB/netfw/thaweddb

[netids]
homePath   = $SPLUNK_DB/netids/db
coldPath   = $SPLUNK_DB/netids/colddb
thawedPath = $SPLUNK_DB/netids/thaweddb

[netlb]
homePath   = $SPLUNK_DB/netlb/db
coldPath   = $SPLUNK_DB/netlb/colddb
thawedPath = $SPLUNK_DB/netlb/thaweddb

[netops]
homePath   = $SPLUNK_DB/netops/db
coldPath   = $SPLUNK_DB/netops/colddb
thawedPath = $SPLUNK_DB/netops/thaweddb

[netwaf]
homePath   = $SPLUNK_DB/netwaf/db
coldPath   = $SPLUNK_DB/netwaf/colddb
thawedPath = $SPLUNK_DB/netwaf/thaweddb

[netproxy]
homePath   = $SPLUNK_DB/netproxy/db
coldPath   = $SPLUNK_DB/netproxy/colddb
thawedPath = $SPLUNK_DB/netproxy/thaweddb

[netipam]
homePath   = $SPLUNK_DB/netipam/db
coldPath   = $SPLUNK_DB/netipam/colddb
thawedPath = $SPLUNK_DB/netipam/thaweddb

[oswinsec]
homePath   = $SPLUNK_DB/oswinsec/db
coldPath   = $SPLUNK_DB/oswinsec/colddb
thawedPath = $SPLUNK_DB/oswinsec/thaweddb

[osnix]
homePath   = $SPLUNK_DB/osnix/db
coldPath   = $SPLUNK_DB/osnix/colddb
thawedPath = $SPLUNK_DB/osnix/thaweddb

[oswin]
homePath   = $SPLUNK_DB/oswin/db
coldPath   = $SPLUNK_DB/oswin/colddb
thawedPath = $SPLUNK_DB/oswin/thaweddb

[syslogng_fallback]
homePath   = $SPLUNK_DB/syslogng_fallback/db
coldPath   = $SPLUNK_DB/syslogng_fallback/colddb
thawedPath = $SPLUNK_DB/syslogng_fallback/thaweddb

[_metrics]
datatype=metric
homePath   = $SPLUNK_DB/_metrics/db
coldPath   = $SPLUNK_DB/_metrics/colddb
thawedPath = $SPLUNK_DB/_metrics/thaweddb
```

Save indexes.conf to `/opt/splunk/etc/system/**local`** 

Note: execute this command as root or your standard user (not `splunk`)

```python
sudo nano /opt/splunk/etc/system/local/indexes.conf
```

Change into `/opt/splunk/bin` and restart Splunk Enterprise as the `splunk` user.

```bash
./splunk restart
```

**Note**: **do not edit `/opt/splunk/etc/system/default/indexes.conf`**
This step will create the following default indexes that are used by SC4S:

- `email`
- `epav`
- `fireeye`
- `gitops`
- `infraops`
- `netauth`
- `netdlp`
- `netdns`
- `netfw`
- `netids`
- `netops`
- `netwaf`
- `netproxy`
- `netipam`
- `oswinsec`
- `osnix`
- `_metrics`Â (Optional opt-in for SC4S operational metrics; ensure this is created as a metrics index)

**Verify that the SC4S default indexes are created on web UI (Settings > Indexes).**

### Create a HTTP Event Collector (HEC) token for SC4S

On Splunk Web UI, go to Settings > Data Inputs > HTTP Event Collector > Global Settings

Select Enabled for All Tokens

Set Default Index as main

Uncheck Enable SSL 

Leave HTTP Port Number as 8088

Save

![image.png](image.png)

Click New Token. Name your token and click Next.

![image.png](image%201.png)

Leave Source type as Automatic. Click add all for Allowed Indexes. Select main for Default Index.

Click Review and Submit.

![image.png](image%202.png)

Copy your Token Value and save it on a notepad (we will need this later)

You can also find your token value on Settings > Data Inputs > HTTP Event Collector

![image.png](image%203.png)

![image.png](image%204.png)

### Configure Linux for SC4S

Set the host OS kernel to match the default receiver buffer of SC4S, which is set to 16MB.

Add the following toÂ `/etc/sysctl.conf`:

```python
sudo nano /etc/sysctl.conf
```

```python
net.core.rmem_default = 17039360
net.core.rmem_max = 17039360
```

Apply to the kernel by running the command  `sysctl -p`

```python
sudo sysctl -p
```

Ensure the kernel is not dropping packets (optional)

```python
netstat -su | grep "receive errors" 
```

For Ubuntu, download net-tools on Ubuntu VM with internet connection. Transfer it over to Ubuntu VM without internet connection and install net-tools (optional)

```python
#On Ubuntu VM with internet connection
mkdir net-tools-offline
cd net-tools-offline
sudo chmod -R 755 /home/cyber/net-tools-offline
sudo apt-get download net-tools
```

```python
#On Ubuntu VM without internet connection
cd net-tools-offline
sudo dpkg -i net-tools_1.60+git20181103.0eebece-1ubuntu5_amd64.deb
```

### Install Podman offline on Ubuntu

By default, Podman is installed on CentOS Stream 9 but it is not installed on Ubuntu. 

On a Ubuntu machine with internet connection:

```jsx
mkdir podman-offline
cd podman-offline
sudo chmod -R 755 /home/cyber/podman-offline
sudo apt-get install --download-only podman -o Dir::Cache=/home/cyber/podman-offline
```

If you get permission denied error, run the `sudo apt-get install --download-only` command again.

Transfer `podman-offline` to the Ubuntu host without internet connection.

To install Podman (note archives directory should have been automatically created)

```jsx
cd podman-offline/archives
sudo dpkg -i *.deb
```

### Install SC4S container while offline

You can stage SC4S by downloading the image so that it can be loaded on a host machine, for example on an airgapped system, without internet connectivity.

Download the latest container imageÂ `oci_container.tgz`Â from [SC4S GitHub](https://github.com/splunk/splunk-connect-for-syslog/releases) page.

Transfer the container image to your host machine.

Execute the following command using Podman.

Make a note of the container ID for the resulting load

```python
sudo podman load < oci_container.tar.gz
```

```python
#Example output
Loaded image: ghcr.io/splunk/splunk-connect-for-syslog/container3:3.30.1
```

Use the container ID to create a local label: 

`podman tag <container ID> sc4slocal:latest`

```python
sudo podman tag ghcr.io/splunk/splunk-connect-for-syslog/container3:3.30.1 sc4slocal:latest
```

Create the systemd unit fileÂ `/lib/systemd/system/sc4s.service`

```python
sudo nano /lib/systemd/system/sc4s.service
```

Copy and paste the following - note that this is the edited version of SC4S sample unit file for Podman

```python
[Unit]
Description=SC4S Container
Wants=NetworkManager.service network-online.target
After=NetworkManager.service network-online.target

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target

[Service]
**# Select the locally loaded image
Environment="SC4S_IMAGE=sc4slocal:latest"**

# Required mount point for syslog-ng persist data (including disk buffer)
Environment="SC4S_PERSIST_MOUNT=splunk-sc4s-var:/var/lib/syslog-ng"

# Optional mount point for local overrides and configurations; see notes in docs
Environment="SC4S_LOCAL_MOUNT=/opt/sc4s/local:/etc/syslog-ng/conf.d/local:z"

# Optional mount point for local disk archive (EWMM output) files

ExecStart=/usr/bin/podman run \
        -e "SC4S_CONTAINER_HOST=${SC4SHOST}" \
        -v "$SC4S_PERSIST_MOUNT" \
        -v "$SC4S_LOCAL_MOUNT" \
        -v "$SC4S_ARCHIVE_MOUNT" \
        -v "$SC4S_TLS_MOUNT" \
        --env-file=/opt/sc4s/env_file \
        --health-cmd="/healthcheck.sh" \
        --health-interval=10s --health-retries=6 --health-timeout=6s \
        --network host \
        --name SC4S \
        --rm $SC4S_IMAGE

Restart=on-abnormal
```

### Configure IPv4 forwarding

IPv4 forwarding is not enabled by default. IPv4 forwarding must be enabled for container networking.

To check that IPv4 forwarding is enabled:Â 

```python
sudo sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward
```

To enable IPv4 forwarding:Â 

```python
sudo sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
```

To ensure your changes persist upon reboot:

- Define sysctl settings through files inÂ `/usr/lib/sysctl.d/`andÂ `/etc/sysctl.d/`.
- To override only specific settings, either add a file with a lexically later name inÂ `/etc/sysctl.d/`Â and put following setting there or find this specific setting in one of the existing configuration files and set the value toÂ `1`.

```python
cd /usr/lib/sysctl.d/
```

```python
sudo nano 100-custom.conf
```

```python
net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
```

- Repeat the same steps for `/etc/sysctl.d/`.
- For example, in the `/usr/lib/sysctl.d/` directory, there are few config files. The naming convention is XX-name.conf with XX being a number. Create a custom.conf with a higher number e.g. `100-custom.conf` with the content `net.ipv4.ip_forward=1` .

```python
cyber@SplunkEnt:/usr/lib/sysctl.d$ ls
**100-custom.conf**  50-bubblewrap.conf  50-pid-max.conf
30-tracker.conf  50-default.conf     99-protect-links.conf
```

Create a Podman/Docker local volume that will contain the disk buffer files and other SC4S state files:

```python
sudo podman volume create splunk-sc4s-var
```

Create directories to be used as a mount point for local overrides and configurations:

```python
sudo mkdir -p /opt/sc4s/local
sudo mkdir -p /opt/sc4s/archive
sudo mkdir -p /opt/sc4s/tls
```

Create the environment fileÂ `/opt/sc4s/env_file`Â and replace the HEC_URL and HEC_TOKEN as necessary:

```python
sudo nano /opt/sc4s/env_file
```

```python
SC4S_DEST_SPLUNK_HEC_DEFAULT_URL=https://your.splunk.instance:8088
SC4S_DEST_SPLUNK_HEC_DEFAULT_TOKEN=xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
#Uncomment the following line if using untrusted SSL certificates
SC4S_DEST_SPLUNK_HEC_DEFAULT_TLS_VERIFY=no
```

For example:

```python
SC4S_DEST_SPLUNK_HEC_DEFAULT_URL=http://10.0.0.120:8088
SC4S_DEST_SPLUNK_HEC_DEFAULT_TOKEN=8be8e3f3-49fc-4158-a20c-bcf82be93dda
#Uncomment the following line if using untrusted SSL certificates
SC4S_DEST_SPLUNK_HEC_DEFAULT_TLS_VERIFY=no
```

Configure SC4S for systemd and start SC4S. Verify sc4s is active and running (exit with `q`)

```python
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable sc4s
sudo systemctl start sc4s
sudo systemctl status sc4s
```

Check podman/docker logs for errors:

```python
sudo podman logs SC4S
```

```python
#Example Output
SC4S_ENV_CHECK_HEC: Splunk HEC connection test successful to index=main for sourcetype=sc4s:fallback...
SC4S_ENV_CHECK_HEC: Splunk HEC connection test successful to index=main for sourcetype=sc4s:events...
syslog-ng checking config
sc4s version=3.30.0
starting goss
starting syslog-ng
```

Search on Splunk for successful installation of SC4S:

```python
index=* sourcetype=sc4s:events "starting up"
```

![image.png](image%205.png)

Send sample data to default udp port 514 of SC4S host: `echo âHello SC4Sâ > /dev/udp/<SC4S_ip>/514` 

```python
echo âHello SC4Sâ > /dev/udp/10.0.0.120/514
```

Search for `index=* "Hello SC4S"`

![image.png](image%206.png)

Verify that SC4S is receiving Fortigate logs

![image.png](image%207.png)

## Ingesting FortiGate Logs through FortiGate App (Option 2)

If SC4S does not work for your environment, another option to ingest FortiGate logs on Splunk is through FortiGate App.

Install from file on Splunk web UI: Manage Apps->Install from file->Upload the .tgz file which is downloaded from [https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/2846](https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/2846) ->check the upgrade box-> click restart splunk service.

![image.png](image%208.png)

### Add data input on Splunk server:

Note: From version 1.2, the Splunk TA(Add-on) for fortigate no longer match wildcard source or sourcetype to extract fortigate log data, a default sourcetype fortigate_log is specified in default/props.conf instead, please follow the instruction below to configure your input and props.conf for the App and TA(Add-on).

Navigate to Settings->Data Input->UDP on Splunk Web UI. Click New Local UDP.

For Port, enter `514` and leave other parameters as is.

![image.png](image%209.png)

For Source type, select `fortigate_log` (search for `fortigate_log` in the search bar)

![image.png](image%2010.png)

Click Review and Submit. If you get the error `UDP 514 is not available` use other UDP port (e.g. `5514`). Restart Splunk service for the change to take effect.

```python
/opt/splunk/bin/splunk restart
```

Configure FortiGate to send syslog by following the steps below.

Navigate to Search & Reporting on Splunk web UI. 

Search for `fortigate` and verify that FortiGate logs are being ingested.  

![image.png](image%2011.png)

## Configure FortiGate

Configure Port 1 as WAN interface 

Configure Port 2 as LAN interface. 

Configure DHCP to automatically assign IP addresses to clients connecting to LAN

![image.png](image%2012.png)

Create a new firewall policy to allow LAN to WAN

To simulate an air-gapped environment without internet access, disable the policy for now. 

![image.png](image%2013.png)

![image.png](image%2014.png)

## Configure FortiGate to send syslog

Refer to the admin manual for specific details of configuration to send Reliable syslog using RFC 3195 format, a typical logging configuration will include the following features.

```python
config log syslogd setting 

set status enable
set server (syslog-ng ip)
set source-ip (fortigate ip)
#set port (port number) (default port is 514)
#Verify settings by running "show"
end 

config log memory filter
set forward-traffic enable
set local-traffic enable
set sniffer-traffic disable
set anomaly enable
set voip disable
set multicast-traffic enable
#Verify settings by running "show full-configuration"
end

config system global
set cli-audit-log enable
#Verify settings by running "show"
#Make sure timezone is correct e.g. "Pacific/Auckland"
end

config log setting
set neighbor-event enable
end
```

## **Configure Cisco ISR to send syslog**

Note: this step needs to be verified with a Cisco device in a testing environment. 

```python
show clock
ntp server (IP address of Fortigate)

conf f
logging on
logging (IP address of Syslog server)
logging trap 6
#Use "?" to see what options are available
exit

#Turn on interface by no shut

show logging
#port 514 udp by default

sh run | inc logging
#we can set multiple syslog servers

#Set IP address for int vlan 1
#Test ping to syslog server
conf t

service sequence-numbers
#Assign sequence-numbers to syslogs in order that events occurred on

conf t
line console 0
logging synchronous
#Force Syslog messages to be displayed once configuration has been completed.

```

*Note: in this scenario, we are sending syslogs from network devices to a containerised syslog-ng server using HTTP/HTTPS. This is Splunk teamâs recommended method when using Splunk products. Alternatively, you can send syslogs from network devices to a rsyslog server and rotate the logs. This method is used by other SIEMs like Wazuh. For more details, refer to the Wazuh documentation.*  

# Splunk Universal Forwarder

## **Install Sysmon on Windows**

Download [Sysmon](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/sysmon) and [sysmonconfig.xml](https://github.com/olafhartong/sysmon-modular/blob/master/sysmonconfig.xml)

Extract Sysmon.zip and move sysmonconfig.xml into the Sysmon folder where Sysmon.exe is located.

Run PowerShell as Administrator and change directory to path where extracted Sysmon is located

Move sysmonconfig.xml to the same directory

Install Symon by running `.\Sysmon64.exe -accepteula -i sysmonconfig.xml`

```bash
PS C:\Users\Administrator\Downloads\Sysmon\Sysmon> ls

## **Annex 2: Configure Splunk Universal Forwarder on Linux (optional)**

Note: this step is optional and is only applicable to Linux host. In this demonstration, Ubuntu was used for two hosts. Splunk Enterprise was configured in one host and Splunk Universal Forwarder was configured in another host. 

**Demonstration Setup**

| **Hostname** | **OS** | **Role** | **IP Address** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| siem | Ubuntu 22.04 LTS | Splunk Enterprise (server) | 192.168.1.217 |
| siem3 | Ubuntu 22.04 LTS | Splunk Universal Forwarder (client) | 192.168.1.117 |

Download or transfer Splunk Universal Forwarder (tar archive)

Unpack the tar archive to /opt directory as a non-root user

```bash
sudo tar xvzf Splunk_UF_package_name.tgz -C /opt
```

Create a user called splunk and change the ownership of /opt/splunkforwarder/bin to splunk user

```bash
#Create user splunk 
sudo su -
root@siem3:~# adduser splunk
Adding user `splunk' ...
Adding new group `splunk' (1001) ...
Adding new user `splunk' (1001) with group `splunk' ...
Creating home directory `/home/splunk' ...
Copying files from `/etc/skel' ...
New password: 
Retype new password:

Changing the user information for splunk
Enter the new value, or press ENTER for the default
	Full Name []: 
	Room Number []: 
	Work Phone []: 
	Home Phone []: 
	Other []: 
Is the information correct? [Y/n] Y 

#make the splunk user the owner of the splunk directory and verify
siem@siem3:~$ sudo chown -R splunk:splunk /opt/splunkforwarder/
siem@siem3:~$ cd /opt
siem@siem3:/opt$ ls -la
total 12
drwxr-xr-x  3 root   root   4096 Aug 13 10:05 .
drwxr-xr-x 20 root   root   4096 Aug 13 07:48 ..
drwxr-xr-x  9 splunk splunk 4096 Jul 20 10:23 splunkforwarder

siem@siem3:/opt$ **su splunk**
Password: 
splunk@siem3:/opt$ cd splunkforwarder/bin
splunk@siem3:/opt/splunkforwarder/bin$ ./splunk start --accept-license
#Create admin credentials (i.e. user account for UF, e.g. splunk:password)

#At some point after the setup, enable boot-start by running
siem@siem3:/opt/splunkforwarder/bin$ sudo ./splunk enable boot-start
```

**Connect to the deployment server**

Deployment server allows engineers/system admins to push out apps to multiple splunk instances and apps is easier way to handle changes (e.g. changes in config)

```bash
splunk@siem3:/opt/splunkforwarder/bin$ ./splunk set deploy-poll 192.168.1.217:8089
#Enter admin credentials
```

Verify that there is deploymentclient.conf in /opt/splunkforwarder/etc/system/local

```bash
cat /opt/splunkforwarder/etc/system/local/deploymentclient.conf
...
targetUri = 192.168.1.217:8089
```

Setup Splunk to send logs to another location by adding forward server

```bash
splunk@siem3:/opt/splunkforwarder/bin$ ./splunk add forward-server 192.168.1.217:9997
```

Verify that there is outputs.conf in /opt/splunkforwarder/etc/system/local

```bash
cat /opt/splunkforwarder/etc/system/local/outputs.conf
...
server = 192.168.1.217:9997
```

Restart Splunk Forwarder for changes to take effect

```bash
splunk@siem3:/opt/splunkforwarder/bin$ ./splunk restart
```

On web UI of Splunk Enterprise, go to settings, forwarder management.

You should be able to see your host machine that has been connected to your deployment server.

Try refreshing the web browser or restart Splunk Enterprise

```bash
splunk@siem:/opt/splunk/bin$ ./splunk restart
```
