# **Understanding DFIR**

## **What is DFIR?**

**Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR)** refers to the combined processes of gathering and analysing digital evidence to detect, investigate, and respond to cyber incidents.

- **Digital Forensics**: The process of identifying, collecting, preserving, and analysing evidence from digital devices.
- **Incident Response**: The structured approach to managing the aftermath of a security breach or attack, with the goal of limiting damage and reducing recovery time and costs.

## **Why DFIR Matters to Us**

1. **Rapid Detection and Response**
    - **Early Threat Detection**: Identifies potential threats before they can escalate into significant incidents.
    - **Efficient Incident Handling**: Enables swift and structured response to mitigate damage.
2. **Evidence Collection and Preservation**
    - **Forensic Analysis**: Collects detailed evidence, ensuring it can be used to understand incidents or support legal investigations.
    - **Compliance**: Helps meet regulatory requirements for incident reporting and evidence preservation.
3. **Minimising Impact**
    - **Damage Control**: Ensures that the impact of any incident is limited by taking rapid response measures.
    - **Recovery and Learning**: Facilitates prompt system recovery and helps learn from incidents to improve defenses.
4. **Improved Visibility and Monitoring**
    - **Comprehensive Analysis**: Provides deep insights into endpoints and activities, ensuring comprehensive monitoring and forensic analysis.

## **Benefits of Implementing DFIR**

- **Proactive Threat Management**: Identifies and responds to potential threats before they become major incidents.
- **Streamlined Investigations**: Enables effective evidence collection and forensic analysis.
- **Operational Continuity**: Minimises downtime by responding rapidly to incidents.
- **Compliance Support**: Ensures regulatory requirements for incident management and digital evidence are met.
- **Cost Efficiency**: Reduces the costs associated with long recovery times and system outages.

## **DFIR Solution**

### **Velociraptor**

- **Endpoint Visibility and Control**: Velociraptor provides deep visibility into endpoints, allowing us to hunt for indicators of compromise (IoCs) across the network.
- **Flexible Querying**: Utilises Velociraptor Query Language (VQL) to perform detailed investigations on endpoint activity.
- **Rapid Data Collection**: Gathers information quickly from multiple endpoints for analysis.
- **Scalable and Extensible**: Designed to scale across large environments, with community-contributed plugins and scripts to enhance capabilities.

## **How DFIR Works**

1. **Detection**
    - **Monitoring and Alerts**: Detects suspicious activities and alerts the response team.
2. **Investigation**
    - **Data Collection**: Collects data from endpoints using Velociraptor or GRR for forensic analysis.
    - **Analysis**: analyses the collected data to identify the root cause and understand the scope of the incident.
3. **Containment and Eradication**
    - **Containment Measures**: Limits the spread of an incident by isolating affected systems.
    - **Eradication**: Removes the malicious artifacts from systems to prevent recurrence.
4. **Recovery**
    - **Restoration**: Restores systems to normal operation, ensuring no remnants of the threat remain.
5. **Lessons Learned**
    - **Review**: analyses what went wrong, what worked, and what can be improved in the incident response process.
