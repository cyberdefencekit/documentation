# **Suricata**

Suricata is an open-source network threat detection engine developed by the Open Information Security Foundation (OISF). It provides capabilities for real-time intrusion detection (IDS), inline intrusion prevention (IPS), network security monitoring (NSM), and offline packet capture (pcap) processing.

## **Lab Setup for Proof of Concept**

In this proof of concept, instead of simulating attacks, the Windows host acted as a compromised machine where malicious websites were visited to trigger alerts in a safe and controlled setting.

| **Host** | **OS** | **Role** | **IP Address** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| pfsense | FreeBSD (pfSense v2.7.2) | Firewall/Router (Gateway IDS/IPS) | 192.168.1.200 (WAN) / 10.0.0.2 (LAN) |
| Suricata | Ubuntu 22.04 LTS | Host IDS/IPS | 10.0.0.27 |
| WS2019 | Windows Server 2019 | Compromised machine | 10.0.0.24 |

## **Install Suricata on Host**

In this demonstration, we will be installing Suricata on the Ubuntu virtual machine. We will be simulating install in an air-gapped environment but note that some parts of the step requires internet connection.

On a Ubuntu machine with internet access
Add the necessary repository for Suricata:

```python
sudo apt-get install software-properties-common
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:oisf/suricata-stable
sudo apt-get update
```

Create a directory to store Suricata. Adjust the directory permissions:

```bash
sudo mkdir ~/suricata-offline
cd ~/suricata-offline
sudo chmod 755 ~/suricata-offline
```

Download the Suricata package and all its dependencies:

Download the Emerging Threats Open rule set:

```bash
sudo apt-get download suricata
sudo wget https://rules.emergingthreats.net/open/suricata-7.0.6/emerging.rules.tar.gz
```

Create a directory to store dependencies. Adjust the directory permissions:

```bash
sudo mkdir dependencies
cd dependencies
sudo chmod 755 ~/suricata-offline/dependencies
```

Download the required dependencies

```bash
sudo apt-get download autoconf automake build-essential cargo cbindgen \
    libjansson-dev libpcap-dev libpcre2-dev libtool libyaml-dev make \
    pkg-config rustc zlib1g-dev libc6-dev gcc g++ dpkg-dev binutils \
    libpcre2-16-0 libpcre2-posix3 libdpkg-perl libstd-rust-dev libssh2-1 \
    libpcap0.8-dev m4 autotools-dev binutils-common libbinutils \
    binutils-x86-64-linux-gnu g++-11 gcc-11 libc-dev-bin linux-libc-dev \
    libcrypt-dev rpcsvc-proto libtirpc-dev libnsl-dev libdbus-1-dev \
    libstd-rust-1.75 libctf-nobfd0 libctf0 lto-disabled-list libstdc++-11-dev \
    libcc1-0 libgcc-11-dev libsigsegv2 libc6=2.35-0ubuntu3.8 libitm1 \
    libasan6 liblsan0 libtsan0 libubsan1 libquadmath0 \
    libevent-pthreads-2.1-7 libhiredis0.14 libhtp2 libhyperscan5 \

```

Transfer suricata-offline folder to /opt directory in Ubuntu machine without internet access. 

Install dependencies and suricata

```bash
cd /opt/suricata-offline/dependencies
sudo dpkg -i *
```

Install Suricata

```bash
cd /opt/suricata-offline/
sudo dpkg -i suricata_1%3a7.0.6-0ubuntu2_amd64.deb
```

After installing Suricata, you can check which version of Suricata you have running and with what options, as well as the service state:

Suricata is running in exited state, which typically indicates that the service started successfully and then exited without issues because it's running in IDS mode.

```bash
sudo suricata --build-info
sudo systemctl status suricata
```

### **Basic setup**

First, determine the interface(s) and IP address(es) on which Suricata should be inspecting network packets:

```bash
ip a
...
2: ens32: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc fq_codel state UP group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 00:0c:29:51:ef:1b brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    altname enp2s0
    inet 10.0.0.25/24 brd 10.0.0.255 scope global noprefixroute ens32
```

Use that information to configure Suricata:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/suricata/suricata.yaml
```

Specify internal network in the HOME_NET 

Specify network interface in af-packet and pcap.

Set use-mmap to yes.

Set community-id to true

```bash
vars:
  # more specific is better for alert accuracy and performance
  address-groups:
    HOME_NET: "[10.0.0.0/24]"
...
community-id: true
...
af-packet:
    - interface: ens32
      cluster-id: 99
      cluster-type: cluster_flow
      defrag: yes
      use-mmap: yes
...
# Cross platform libpcap capture support
pcap:
  - interface: ens32
  
 checksum-validation: no
```

### **Suricata-update offline**

Run `suricata-update` to update rules and create /var/lib/suricata folder

Note it is expected to get the error “Failed to fetch https://rules.emergingthreats.net/open/suricata-7.0.6/emerging.rules.tar.gz:”

```bash
sudo suricata-update
```

Make a folder called suricata-rules and extract `emerging.rules.tar.gz` to that directory

```bash
sudo mkdir suricata-rules
sudo tar -xvzf emerging.rules.tar.gz -C /opt/suricata-offline/suricata-rules/
```

Append the rules from the file to the main /var/lib/suricata/rules/suricata.rules file

```bash
sudo bash -c 'find /opt/suricata-offline/suricata-rules/rules/ -name "*.rules" -exec cat {} + >> /var/lib/suricata/rules/suricata.rules'
```

### **Suricata-update online (recommended)**

Running suricata-update with internet connection simplifies the process of downloading and installing rulesets.

```bash
sudo suricata-update
```

You can also list sources and download rules from a specific source

```bash
sudo suricata-update list-sources
```

**Summary of different license types:**

- **MIT** is very permissive, allowing almost any use, even commercial.
- **Commercial** requires you to pay or subscribe for usage rights, often with strict terms.
- **CC-BY-SA-4.0** requires you to give credit and share any modifications under the same license.
- **GPL-3.0** requires sharing modifications under the same open-source license and offering the source code.
- **Non-Commercial** restricts usage to personal or non-commercial contexts.

To download the ruleset from a specific source, run:

If required, update sources

```bash
sudo suricata-update update-sources
sudo suricata-update enable-source <Name>
sudo suricata-update
```

Test Suricata configuration file by running

```bash
sudo suricata -T -c /etc/suricata/suricata.yaml -v
```

```bash
#Example output

Notice: suricata: This is Suricata version 7.0.6 RELEASE running in SYSTEM mode

```

Note the difference in number of signatures processed, inspecting packet payload and inspect application layers when suricata-update was executed without internet access:

```python
Info: detect: 39669 signatures processed. 1158 are IP-only rules, 4110 are inspecting packet payload, 34193 inspect application layer, 108 are decoder event only
Notice: suricata: Configuration provided was successfully loaded. Exiting.
```

### **Running Suricata**

With the rules installed, Suricata can run properly and thus we restart it:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart suricata
```

To make sure Suricata is running check the Suricata log:

```bash
sudo tail /var/log/suricata/suricata.log
```

The last line will be similar to this:

```bash
5933 - Suricata-Main] 2024-09-12 13:26:11 Notice: threads: Threads created -> W: 2 FM: 1 FR: 1   Engine started.
```

The actual thread count will depend on the system and the configuration.

To see statistics, check the `stats.log` file:

```bash
sudo tail -f /var/log/suricata/stats.log
```

By default, it is updated every 8 seconds to show updated values with the current state, like how many packets have been processed and what type of traffic was decoded.

### **Alerting**

To test the IDS functionality of Suricata it's best to test with a signature. The signature with ID `2100498` from the ET Open ruleset is written specific for such test cases.

2100498:

```bash
alert ip any any -> any any (msg:"GPL ATTACK_RESPONSE id check returned root"; content:"uid=0|28|root|29|"; classtype:bad-unknown; sid:2100498; rev:7; metadata:created_at 2010_09_23, updated_at 2010_09_23;)
```

The syntax and logic behind those signatures is covered in other chapters. This will alert on any IP traffic that has the content within its payload. This rule can be triggered quite easy. Before we trigger it, start `tail` to see updates to `fast.log`.

```bash
curl http://testmynids.org/uid/index.html
sudo tail /var/log/suricata/fast.log
```

The following output should now be seen in the log:

```bash
09/12/2024-13:51:32.520238  [**] [1:2100498:7] GPL ATTACK_RESPONSE id check returned root [**] [Classification: Potentially Bad Traffic] [Priority: 2] {TCP} 65.9.141.53:80 -> 10.0.0.25:34606Alerts:
```

This should include the timestamp and the IP of your system.

### **Custom rules**

Stop Suricata service:

```bash
sudo systemctl stop suricata
```

Create local.rules

```bash
sudo nano /usr/share/suricata/rules/local.rules
```

Write following rule to alert on ping to internal network (note syntax is very similar to Snort)

```bash
alert icmp any any -> $HOME_NET any (msg: "ICMP Ping Detected"; sid:1; rev:1;)
```

Edit suricata.yml

```bash
sudo nano /etc/suricata/suricata.yaml 
```

Add local.rules to rule-files

```bash
default-rule-path: /var/lib/suricata/rules

rule-files:
  - suricata.rules
  - /usr/share/suricata/rules/local.rules
```

Test Suricata configuration:

```bash
sudo suricata -T -c /etc/suricata/suricata.yaml -v
```

Start Suricata and verify it is running and active. 

```bash
sudo systemctl start suricata
sudo systemctl status suricata
```

Execute ping to Suricata host from another host in internal network

Verify that the alerts have been logged

```bash
sudo tail /var/log/suricata/fast.log
```

```bash
09/12/2024-14:14:31.052314  [**] [1:1:1] ICMP Ping Detected [**] [Classification: (null)] [Priority: 3] {ICMP} 10.0.0.25:0 -> 10.0.0.20:0
09/12/2024-14:14:57.907164  [**] [1:1:1] ICMP Ping Detected [**] [Classification: (null)] [Priority: 3] {ICMP} 10.0.0.20:3 -> 10.0.0.1:3
```

### **EVE JSON**

The more advanced output is the EVE JSON output which is explained in detail in [Eve JSON Output](https://docs.suricata.io/en/latest/output/eve/eve-json-output.html#eve-json-output). To see what this looks like it's recommended to use `jq` to parse the JSON output.
Alerts:

```bash
sudo tail /var/log/suricata/eve.json | jq 'select(.event_type=="alert")'
```

This will display more detail about each alert with a better readability, including meta-data.

```bash
{
  "timestamp": "2024-09-12T14:21:18.932116+1200",
  "flow_id": 1750955545135946,
  "in_iface": "ens32",
  "event_type": "alert",
  "src_ip": "10.0.0.25",
  "src_port": 0,
  "dest_ip": "10.0.0.20",
  "dest_port": 0,
  "proto": "ICMP",
  "icmp_type": 0,
  "icmp_code": 0,
  "pkt_src": "wire/pcap",
  "community_id": "1:7Z0C1taw8mzKweAktDBR9AYDoBA=",
  "alert": {
    "action": "allowed",
    "gid": 1,
    "signature_id": 1,
    "rev": 1,
    "signature": "ICMP Ping Detected",
    "category": "",
    "severity": 3
  },
  "direction": "to_client",
  "flow": {
    "pkts_toserver": 1,
    "pkts_toclient": 1,
    "bytes_toserver": 98,
    "bytes_toclient": 98,
    "start": "2024-09-12T14:21:18.931964+1200",
    "src_ip": "10.0.0.20",
    "dest_ip": "10.0.0.25"
  }
}
```

Stats:

```bash
sudo tail -f /var/log/suricata/eve.json | jq 'select(.event_type=="stats")|.stats.capture.kernel_packets'
sudo tail -f /var/log/suricata/eve.json | jq 'select(.event_type=="stats")'
```

The first example displays the number of packets captured by the kernel; the second examples shows all of the statistics.

### **Setting up IPS inline for Linux**

### **Setting up IPS with Netfilter**

To check if you have NFQ enabled in your Suricata build, enter the following command:

```python
suricata --build-info
```

and make sure that `NFQueue support: yes` is listed in the output.

Edit local.rules to add a sample rule for IPS mode:

```bash
sudo nano /usr/share/suricata/rules/local.rules
```

```python
#IDS Mode
alert icmp any any -> $HOME_NET any (msg: "ICMP Ping Detected"; sid:1; rev:1;)

#IPS Mode
drop icmp any any -> 1.1.1.1 any (msg:"ICMP Detected and Blocked to 1.1.1.1"; sid:2; rev:1;)
```

Run Suricata with the NFQ mode and use the `-q` option. This option tells Suricata which queue numbers it should use.

```python
sudo suricata -c /etc/suricata/suricata.yaml -q 0
```

In this scenario, you are sending traffic that is generated by your computer to Suricata. Run:

```python
sudo iptables -I INPUT -j NFQUEUE
sudo iptables -I OUTPUT -j NFQUEUE
```

If Suricata is installed on the gateway (e.g. Firewall), you can send traffic that passes through Suricata by running:

```python
sudo iptables -I FORWARD -j NFQUEUE
```

Execute `ping 1.1.1.1` and check Suricata alerts:

```python
ping 1.1.1.1
tail -f /var/log/suricata/fast.log
```

```python
09/14/2024-16:11:08.050136  [Drop] [**] [1:2:1] ICMP Detected and Blocked to 1.1.1.1 [**] [Classification: (null)] [Priority: 3] {ICMP} 10.0.0.27:8 -> 1.1.1.1:0
```

To see if you have set your `iptables` rules correct make sure Suricata is running and enter:

```python
sudo iptables -vnL
```

In the example you can see if packets are being logged.

```python
Chain INPUT (policy ACCEPT 0 packets, 0 bytes)
 pkts bytes target     prot opt in     out     source               destination         
 1032 1101K NFQUEUE    all  --  *      *       0.0.0.0/0            0.0.0.0/0            NFQUEUE num 0

Chain FORWARD (policy ACCEPT 0 packets, 0 bytes)
 pkts bytes target     prot opt in     out     source               destination         

Chain OUTPUT (policy ACCEPT 0 packets, 0 bytes)
 pkts bytes target     prot opt in     out     source               destination         
 1469  126K NFQUEUE    all  --  *      *       0.0.0.0/0            0.0.0.0/0            NFQUEUE num 0
```

## **Install Suricata on Gateway**

While Suricata can be installed on a host, it can also be installed on a gateway such as **pfSense**. The pfSense is a free and open source firewall and router. For installing and configuring pfSense, refer to pfSense [documentation](https://docs.netgate.com/pfsense/en/latest/) and instruction [video](https://youtu.be/Ayr_av2EX_U?si=c4k5XdMjTvNpqRa4). pfSense can be downloaded from [here.](https://www.pfsense.org/download/)

Full demonstration video on configuring Suricata on pfSense can be found [here](https://youtu.be/u1gZrJEQ_30?si=9rbd6SHLVnTHhHoz). 

After competing basic configuration on pfSense, navigate to System > Package Manager > Available Packages on pfSense web UI.

Search for `suricata` and click install (confirm when prompted). Internet connection is required.

![image.png](image.png)

![image.png](image%201.png)

Once install is complete, navigate to Services > Suricata > Global Settings.

Select **Install ETOpen Emerging Threats rules, Install Feodo Tracker Botnet C2 IP rules** and **Install ABUSE.ch SSL Blacklist rules**.

![image.png](image%202.png)

Select 1 Day for Update Interval and select **Live Rule Swap on Update**.

![image.png](image%203.png)

Leave rest of settings default and click save.

Navigate to Update section and click Update.

![image.png](image%204.png)

Once rule set update is complete, you will see timestamps of recent update.

![image.png](image%205.png)

Navigate to Interfaces section and click Add.

![image.png](image%206.png)

Select interface to run Suricata. In this demonstration, Suricata is installed on the LAN interface.

![image.png](image%207.png)

For the EVE Output Settings, select EVE JSON Log and Output Type as FILE. Leave rest of the settings as default values and click Save.

![image.png](image%208.png)

Within the Interface section, navigate to LAN Categories and Select All rulesets and click Save.

You can read about each rule in the LAN Rules section and enable certain rule instead of enabling all rules. [Pointproof documentation](https://tools.emergingthreats.net/docs/ETPro%20Rule%20Categories.pdf) explains about the emerging rules. 

![image.png](image%209.png)

On pfSense VM, selection option 8 for shell and run `top -s 1` to monitor CPU

```python
top -s 1
```

![image.png](image%2010.png)

Navigate back to Interfaces section and run Suricata by clicking the play button.

![image.png](image%2011.png)

After a while, you will see a green tick box on Suricata Status, but CPU usage is still at 99%. Wait until CPU usage drops below 30% of pfSense VM CLI.

![image.png](image%2012.png)

Navigate to the Alerts tab, and verify that there are no alerts.

![image.png](image%2013.png)

### **Testing IDS**

Suricata by default generates alert when a user access .to domain. From the Windows host connected to pfSense on an internal network, navigate to [https://amzn.to/3xPjJbS](https://amzn.to/3xPjJbS) on a web browser.

Note that the alerts have been generated but these are false positives.

![image.png](image%2014.png)

### **Finetuning rules to reduce false positives**

Copy GID:SID `1:2027757` . Navigate to SID Mgmt tab, select Enable Automatic SID State Management. Edit the **disablesid-sample.conf**

![image.png](image%2015.png)

Edit the List Name as LAN-Disabled. Delete the existing content and copy and paste the following:

```python
#ET DNS Query for .to TLD
1:2027757
```

![image.png](image%2016.png)

Repeat the same process for **dropsid-sample.conf** and **enablesid-sample.conf.** Change the List Name of **dropsid-sample.conf** to **LAN-Drops** and **enablesid-sample.conf** to **LAN-Enabled**. Make sure they each have **nothing** in the content.

For Interface SID Management List Assignments, select **Rebuild**. Select **LAN-Enabled** for Enable SID List, **LAN-Disabled** for Disable SID List.

![image.png](image%2017.png)

Navigate back to Alerts tab and clear alerts

![image.png](image%2018.png)

From the Windows host connected to pfSense on an internal network. Wait for CPU percentage to drop. Navigate to [https://amzn.to/3xPjJbS](https://amzn.to/3xPjJbS) on a web browser. Verify that alerts have not been generated.

![image.png](image%2019.png)

Navigate to Interface Settings > LAN Rules. Select emerging-dns.rules.

![image.png](image%2020.png)

Search for `.to` . Verify that ET DNS Query for .to TLD is Auto-disabled by settings on SID Mgmt tab.

![image.png](image%2021.png)

### **Testing IPS**

Disable Hardware Checksum Offloading. Navigate to System > Advanced > Networking.

Select Disable hardware checksum offload and save. pfSense will reboot to apply changes.

![image.png](image%2022.png)

Navigate to Suricata > LAN Interface settings

In the Alert and Block Settings, select Block Offenders and Inline mode for IPS mode.

![image.png](image%2023.png)

Navigate to SID Mgmt and edit LAN-Drops. Copy and paste the following list:

```python
emerging-3coresec
emerging-ciarmy
emerging-compromised
emerging-current_events
emerging-drop
emerging-dshield
emerging-dns
emerging-botcc
emerging-malware
emerging-tor
emerging-trojan
emerging-scan
feodotracker
sslblacklist_tls_cert
```

![image.png](image%2024.png)

For Interface SID Management List Assignments, select Rebuild and select LAN-Drops for Drop SID LIst. Click Save.

![image.png](image%2025.png)

Navigate to Interface tab and restart Suricata

![image.png](image%2026.png)

On Windows host, browse through **`http://malware.wicar.org/`**: This site hosts files and URLs that trigger IPS/IDS signatures without actually hosting real malware.

Verify that the alerts have been generated.

![image.png](image%2027.png)

Part of our LAN-Drops includes a rule that will drop a traffic when a user visits `.cc` TLD

From Windows host, run `nslookup something.cc` 

```python
PS C:\Users\Administrator\Downloads> nslookup something.cc
Server:  UnKnown
Address:  ::1

DNS request timed out.
    timeout was 2 seconds.
DNS request timed out.
    timeout was 2 seconds.
*** Request to UnKnown timed-out
```

Alerts log shows that DNS query to .cc TLD has been dropped
