# **Understanding SOAR**

## **Introduction**

In the ever-evolving landscape of cybersecurity, the volume and complexity of cyber threats are increasing rapidly. Traditional security measures are often insufficient to handle the sheer amount of data and alerts generated daily. To enhance our cybersecurity posture and streamline our response to threats, we are implementing **Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR)** solutions.

This document aims to explain what SOAR is, why it's crucial for our organisation, and how it impacts various stakeholders.

## **What is SOAR?**

**Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR)** is a set of technologies that enable organisations to collect security threat data and alerts from multiple sources. SOAR solutions allow for the automation of responses to low-level threats and the orchestration of complex processes involving multiple tools and teams.

- **Security Orchestration**: Integrates different security tools and systems to work together seamlessly.
- **Automation**: Automates routine and repetitive security tasks to improve efficiency.
- **Response**: Facilitates swift and effective responses to security incidents.

## **Why SOAR Matters to Us**

1. **Efficiency and Productivity**
    - **Reduced Manual Work**: Automates repetitive tasks, freeing up our security team to focus on more critical issues.
    - **Faster Response Times**: Automates incident responses to mitigate threats more quickly.
2. **Enhanced Threat Management**
    - **Improved Detection**: Correlates data from various sources for better threat detection.
    - **Comprehensive Response**: Coordinates actions across different security tools for effective threat mitigation.
3. **Scalability**
    - **Handling Alert Fatigue**: Manages the growing number of security alerts without overburdening the team.
    - **Adaptability**: Scales with our organisation's growth and evolving security needs.
4. **Regulatory Compliance**
    - **Consistent Processes**: Ensures compliance through standardized and documented response procedures.
    - **Audit Readiness**: Maintains logs and reports necessary for audits and compliance checks.

## **Benefits of Implementing SOAR**

- **Improved Security Posture**: Enhances our ability to detect and respond to threats effectively.
- **Operational Efficiency**: Streamlines security operations through automation and integration.
- **Cost Reduction**: Lowers operational costs by reducing the need for manual intervention.
- **Stakeholder Confidence**: Demonstrates our commitment to robust cybersecurity practices.

## **How SOAR Works**

1. **Data Collection**: Aggregates security data from various sources such as firewalls, IDS/IPS, and endpoint protection systems.
2. **Analysis**: Uses advanced analytics to identify and prioritize security threats.
3. **Automation**: Executes predefined workflows to respond to specific types of threats automatically.
4. **Orchestration**: Coordinates actions across multiple security tools and teams for a unified response.
5. **Reporting**: Generates reports and dashboards for continuous monitoring and improvement.
