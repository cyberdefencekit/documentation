## Wazuh

## **Install Wazuh Server offline**

You can install Wazuh even when there is no connection to the Internet. Installing the solution offline involves downloading the Wazuh central components to later install them on a system with no Internet connection. The Wazuh server, the Wazuh indexer, and the Wazuh dashboard can be installed and configured on the same host in an all-in-one deployment, or each component can be installed on a separate host as a distributed deployment, depending on your environment needs. Check [requirements for Wazuh Server](https://documentation.wazuh.com/current/installation-guide/wazuh-server/index.html).

**Note:** You need root user privileges to run all the commands described below.

### Configure Firewall rule

Configure Firewall rule to allow access on required ports

CentOS:

```python
firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-port=9200/tcp --permanent #Wazuh-indexer
firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-port=55000/tcp --permanent #enrollment service
firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-port=1514/tcp --permanent #agent communication
firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-port=1515/tcp --permanent #enrollment service

#Apply changes
firewall-cmd --reload

#Check applied
firewall-cmd --list-all
```

Ubuntu:

```bash
ufw allow 9200/tcp
ufw allow 55000/tcp
ufw allow 1514/tcp
ufw allow 1515/tcp
```

### **Download the packages and configuration files**

Run the following commands from any Linux system with Internet connection. This action executes a script that downloads all required files for the offline installation on x86_64 architectures. Select the package format to download.

For rpm:

```python
curl -sO https://packages.wazuh.com/4.9/wazuh-install.sh
chmod 744 wazuh-install.sh
./wazuh-install.sh -dw rpm
```

For deb:

```jsx
curl -sO https://packages.wazuh.com/4.9/wazuh-install.sh
chmod 744 wazuh-install.sh
./wazuh-install.sh -dw deb
```

Download the certificates configuration file.

```python
curl -sO https://packages.wazuh.com/4.9/config.yml
```

Edit `config.yml` to prepare the certificates creation. As we are performing an all-in-one deployment, replace `"<indexer-node-ip>"`, `"<wazuh-manager-ip>"`, and `"<dashboard-node-ip>"` with `127.0.0.1` or your preferred IP address.

```python
nodes:
  # Wazuh indexer nodes
  indexer:
    - name: node-1
      ip: 10.0.0.20
    #- name: node-2
    #  ip: "<indexer-node-ip>"
    #- name: node-3
    #  ip: "<indexer-node-ip>"

  # Wazuh server nodes
  # If there is more than one Wazuh server
  # node, each one must have a node_type
  server:
    - name: wazuh-1
      ip: 10.0.0.20
    #  node_type: master
    #- name: wazuh-2
    #  ip: "<wazuh-manager-ip>"
    #  node_type: worker
    #- name: wazuh-3
    #  ip: "<wazuh-manager-ip>"
    #  node_type: worker

  # Wazuh dashboard nodes
  dashboard:
    - name: dashboard
      ip: 10.0.0.20

```

Run the ./wazuh-install.sh -g to create the certificates. For a multi-node cluster, these certificates need to be later deployed to all Wazuh instances in your cluster.

```python
./wazuh-install.sh -g
```

Copy or move the following files to a directory on the host(s) from where the offline installation will be carried out. You can use `scp` for this.

- `wazuh-install.sh`
- `wazuh-offline.tar.gz`
- `wazuh-install-files.tar`

### **Install Wazuh components from local files**

Note: Internet access was disabled at this point for offline installation.

In the working directory where you placed `wazuh-offline.tar.gz` and `wazuh-install-files.tar`, execute the following command to decompress the installation files:

```python
tar xf wazuh-offline.tar.gz
tar xf wazuh-install-files.tar
```

### **Install the Wazuh indexer**

Run the following commands to install the Wazuh indexer.

For rpm:

```python
rpm --import ./wazuh-offline/wazuh-files/GPG-KEY-WAZUH
rpm -ivh ./wazuh-offline/wazuh-packages/wazuh-indexer*.rpm
```

For deb:

```jsx
dpkg -i ./wazuh-offline/wazuh-packages/wazuh-indexer*.deb
```

Run the following commands replacing `<indexer-node-name>` with the name of the Wazuh indexer node you are configuring as defined in `config.yml`. For example, `node-1`. This deploys the SSL certificates to encrypt communications between the Wazuh central components.

Note: On CentOS, if you encounter the error chmod: cannot access '/etc/wazuh-indexer/certs/*': No such file or directort, cd /etc/wazuh-indexer/certs/ and run chmod 400 * as a root user

```python
NODE_NAME=node-1
```

```python
mkdir /etc/wazuh-indexer/certs
mv -n wazuh-install-files/$NODE_NAME.pem /etc/wazuh-indexer/certs/indexer.pem
mv -n wazuh-install-files/$NODE_NAME-key.pem /etc/wazuh-indexer/certs/indexer-key.pem
mv wazuh-install-files/admin-key.pem /etc/wazuh-indexer/certs/
mv wazuh-install-files/admin.pem /etc/wazuh-indexer/certs/
cp wazuh-install-files/root-ca.pem /etc/wazuh-indexer/certs/
chmod 500 /etc/wazuh-indexer/certs
chmod 400 /etc/wazuh-indexer/certs/*
chown -R wazuh-indexer:wazuh-indexer /etc/wazuh-indexer/certs
```

*Here you move the node certificate and key files, such as node-1.pem and node-1-key.pem, to their corresponding certs folder. They are specific to the node and are not required on the other nodes. However, note that the root-ca.pem certificate isn't moved but copied to the certs folder. This way, you can continue deploying it to other component folders in the next steps.*

Edit `/etc/wazuh-indexer/opensearch.yml` and replace the following values:

1. `network.host`: Sets the address of this node for both HTTP and transport traffic. The node will bind to this address and will also use it as its publish address. Accepts an IP address or a hostname.
    
    Use the same node address set in `config.yml` to create the SSL certificates.
    
2. `node.name`: Name of the Wazuh indexer node as defined in the `config.yml` file. For example, `node-1`.
3. `cluster.initial_master_nodes`: List of the names of the master-eligible nodes. These names are defined in the `config.yml` file. 

```python
network.host: "10.0.0.20"
node.name: "node-1"
cluster.initial_master_nodes:
- "node-1"
#- "node-2"
#- "node-3"
```

Enable and start the Wazuh indexer service. Verify Wazuh indexer is active and running (exit with `q`)

```python
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl enable wazuh-indexer
systemctl start wazuh-indexer
sys
```

When all Wazuh indexer nodes are running, run the Wazuh indexer `indexer-security-init.sh` script on *any Wazuh indexer node* to load the new certificates information and start the cluster.

```python
/usr/share/wazuh-indexer/bin/indexer-security-init.sh
```

Run the following command to check that the installation is successful. 

```python
curl -XGET https://10.0.0.20:9200 -u admin:admin -k
```

```python
#Example response

    "minimum_index_compatibility_version" : "7.0.0"
  },
  "tagline" : "The OpenSearch Project: https://opensearch.org/"
}
```

### **Installing the Wazuh server**

### **Installing the Wazuh manager**

Run the following commands to import the Wazuh key and install the Wazuh manager.

For rpm:

```python
rpm --import ./wazuh-offline/wazuh-files/GPG-KEY-WAZUH
rpm -ivh ./wazuh-offline/wazuh-packages/wazuh-manager*.rpm
```

For deb:

```jsx
dpkg -i ./wazuh-offline/wazuh-packages/wazuh-manager*.deb
```

Save the Wazuh indexer username and password into the Wazuh manager keystore using the wazuh-keystore tool. The default offline-installation credentials are `admin`:`admin`

```python
/var/ossec/bin/wazuh-keystore -f indexer -k username -v admin
/var/ossec/bin/wazuh-keystore -f indexer -k password -v admin
```

Enable and start the Wazuh manager service. Verify Wazuh manager is active and running (exit with `q`)

```python
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl enable wazuh-manager
systemctl start wazuh-manager
systemctl status wazuh-manager
```

### **Installing Filebeat**

Filebeat must be installed and configured on the same server as the Wazuh manager.

Run the following command to install Filebeat.

For rpm:

```python
rpm -ivh ./wazuh-offline/wazuh-packages/filebeat*.rpm
```

For deb:

```jsx
dpkg -i ./wazuh-offline/wazuh-packages/filebeat*.deb
```

Move a copy of the configuration files to the appropriate location. Ensure to type “yes” at the prompt to overwrite `/etc/filebeat/filebeat.yml`.

Note for CentOS, remove `&&\`

```python
cp ./wazuh-offline/wazuh-files/filebeat.yml /etc/filebeat/ &&\
cp ./wazuh-offline/wazuh-files/wazuh-template.json /etc/filebeat/ &&\
chmod go+r /etc/filebeat/wazuh-template.json
```

Edit the `/etc/filebeat/filebeat.yml` configuration file and replace the following value:
`hosts`: The list of Wazuh indexer nodes to connect to. You can use either IP addresses or hostnames. By default, the host is set to localhost `hosts: ["127.0.0.1:9200"]`. Replace it with your Wazuh indexer address accordingly.

```python
# Wazuh - Filebeat configuration file
 output.elasticsearch:
 **hosts: ["10.0.0.20:9200"]**
 protocol: https
 username: ${username}
 password: ${password}
```

Create a Filebeat keystore to securely store authentication credentials.

```python
filebeat keystore create
```

Add the username and password `admin`:`admin` to the secrets keystore.

```python
echo admin | filebeat keystore add username --stdin --force
echo admin | filebeat keystore add password --stdin --force
```

Install the Wazuh module for Filebeat.

```python
tar -xzf ./wazuh-offline/wazuh-files/wazuh-filebeat-0.4.tar.gz -C /usr/share/filebeat/module
```

Replace `<SERVER_NODE_NAME>` with your Wazuh server node certificate name, the same used in `config.yml` when creating the certificates. For example, `wazuh-1`. Then, move the certificates to their corresponding location.

Note: On CentOS, if you encounter the error chmod: cannot access '/etc/filebeat/certs/*': No such file or directort, cd /etc/filebeat/certs/ and run chmod 400 * as a root user

```python
NODE_NAME=wazuh-1
```

```python
mkdir /etc/filebeat/certs
mv -n wazuh-install-files/$NODE_NAME.pem /etc/filebeat/certs/filebeat.pem
mv -n wazuh-install-files/$NODE_NAME-key.pem /etc/filebeat/certs/filebeat-key.pem
cp wazuh-install-files/root-ca.pem /etc/filebeat/certs/
chmod 500 /etc/filebeat/certs
chmod 400 /etc/filebeat/certs/*
chown -R root:root /etc/filebeat/certs
```

Enable and start the Filebeat service. Verify Filebeat is active and running (exit with `q`)

```python
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl enable filebeat
systemctl start filebeat
systemctl status filebeat
```

Run the following command to make sure Filebeat is successfully installed.

```python
filebeat test output
```

```python
#Example output
elasticsearch: https://10.0.0.20:9200...
  parse url... OK
  connection...
    parse host... OK
    dns lookup... OK
    addresses: 10.0.0.20

    handshake... OK
    TLS version: TLSv1.3
    dial up... OK
  talk to server... OK
  version: 7.10.2
```

Wazuh server node is now successfully installed.

### **Install the Wazuh dashboard**

Run the following commands to install the Wazuh dashboard.

For rpm:

```python
rpm --import ./wazuh-offline/wazuh-files/GPG-KEY-WAZUH
rpm -ivh ./wazuh-offline/wazuh-packages/wazuh-dashboard*.rpm
```

For deb:

```jsx
dpkg -i ./wazuh-offline/wazuh-packages/wazuh-dashboard*.deb
```

Replace `<DASHBOARD_NODE_NAME>` with your Wazuh dashboard node name, the same used in `config.yml` to create the certificates. For example, `dashboard`. Then, move the certificates to their corresponding location.

Note: On CentOS, if you encounter the error chmod: cannot access '/etc/wazuh-dashboard/certs/*': No such file or directort, cd /etc/wazuh-dashboard/certs/ and run chmod 400 * as a root user

```python
NODE_NAME=dashboard
```

```python
mkdir /etc/wazuh-dashboard/certs
mv -n wazuh-install-files/$NODE_NAME.pem /etc/wazuh-dashboard/certs/dashboard.pem
mv -n wazuh-install-files/$NODE_NAME-key.pem /etc/wazuh-dashboard/certs/dashboard-key.pem
cp wazuh-install-files/root-ca.pem /etc/wazuh-dashboard/certs/
chmod 500 /etc/wazuh-dashboard/certs
chmod 400 /etc/wazuh-dashboard/certs/*
chown -R wazuh-dashboard:wazuh-dashboard /etc/wazuh-dashboard/certs
```

Edit the `/etc/wazuh-dashboard/opensearch_dashboards.yml` file and replace the following values:

1. `server.host`: This setting specifies the host of the back end server. To allow remote users to connect, set the value to the IP address or DNS name of the Wazuh dashboard. The value `0.0.0.0` will accept all the available IP addresses of the host.
2. `opensearch.hosts`: The URLs of the Wazuh indexer instances to use for all your queries. The Wazuh dashboard can be configured to connect to multiple Wazuh indexer nodes in the same cluster. The addresses of the nodes can be separated by commas. 

```python
**server.host: 10.0.0.20**
server.port: 443
**opensearch.hosts: https://10.0.0.20:9200**
opensearch.ssl.verificationMode: certificate
```

Enable and start the Wazuh dashboard. Verify Wazuh dashboard is active and running (exit with `q`)

```python
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl enable wazuh-dashboard
systemctl start wazuh-dashboard
systemctl status wazuh-dashboard
```

Edit the file `/usr/share/wazuh-dashboard/data/wazuh/config/wazuh.yml` and replace the `url` value with the IP address or hostname of the Wazuh server master node.

```python
hosts:
  - default:
      url: https://10.0.0.20
      port: 55000
      username: wazuh-wui
      password: wazuh-wui
      run_as: false
```

Access the web interface.

- URL: *https://<WAZUH_DASHBOARD_IP_ADDRESS>*
- **Username**: admin
- **Password**: admin

![image.png](image.png)

### Import Certificate (optional)

Upon the first access to the Wazuh dashboard, the browser shows a warning message stating that the certificate was not issued by a trusted authority. An exception can be added in the advanced options of the web browser or, for increased security, the `root-ca.pem` file previously generated can be imported to the certificate manager of the browser. 

Copy /etc/wazuh-dashboard/certs/root-ca.pem to user’s home directory

Change ownership of user's home directory to the non-root user to enable read access to root-ca.pem

```python
cp /etc/wazuh-dashboard/certs/root-ca.pem /home/siem/root-ca.pem
#Example
chown -R siem:siem /home/siem
-r--------.  1 siem siem       1204 Aug 30 16:32 root-ca.pem
```

On Firefox, go to Settings, Privacy & Security and Certificates

Click View Certificates

![image.png](image%201.png)

Click Import, select root-ca.pem in user’s home directory

Select Trust this CA to identify website and email users

Click OK

![image.png](image%202.png)

Delete root-ca.pem from **user’s home directory**

```python
sudo rm root-ca.pem
```

### **Securing Wazuh installation (optional)**

You have now installed and configured all the Wazuh central components. We recommend changing the default credentials to protect your infrastructure from possible attacks.

Use the Wazuh passwords tool to change all the internal users passwords.

```python
/usr/share/wazuh-indexer/plugins/opensearch-security/tools/wazuh-passwords-tool.sh --api --change-all --admin-user wazuh --admin-password wazuh

#Example output
30/08/2024 23:39:52 INFO: Updating the internal users.

```

Save the new Wazuh indexer password into the Wazuh manager keystore

Restart Wazuh manager service

```python
/var/ossec/bin/wazuh-keystore -f indexer -k password -v o98ak572UvBhYPf*ldKNFHIbI9.t0ujk
systemctl start wazuh-manager
systemctl status wazuh-manager
```

Add the new password to the Filebeat secrets keystore

Restart the Filebeat service

```python
echo "o98ak572UvBhYPf*ldKNFHIbI9.t0ujk" | filebeat keystore add password --stdin --force
systemctl restart filebeat
filebeat test output
```

Verify that new password has been added to /usr/share/wazuh-dashboard/data/wazuh/config/wazuh.yml

Restart the Wazuh dashboard

```python
nano /usr/share/wazuh-dashboard/data/wazuh/config/wazuh.yml
systemctl restart wazuh-dashboard
systemctl status wazuh-dashboard
```

## Install Wazuh agents on endpoints

### Configure Firewall on Windows endpoints

For Wazuh agent to communicate with the Wazuh manager services, the following ports needs to be allowed for outbound connection:

- 1514/TCP for agent communication.
- 1515/TCP for enrollment via automatic agent request.
- 55000/TCP for enrollment via manager API.

Open Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security.

Right-click Outbound Rules and create new rule.

Select Port.

![image.png](image%203.png)

Select TCP and Specific remote ports.

Put 1514, 1515, 55000

Click Next

![image.png](image%204.png)

Select Allow the connection

![image.png](image%205.png)

Select Domain, Private and Public

![image.png](image%206.png)

Name the New Outbound Rule as Wazuh outbound and click Finish

![image.png](image%207.png)

### **Install Wazuh agent on Windows endpoint**

The agent runs on the endpoint you want to monitor and communicates with the Wazuh server, sending data in near real-time through an encrypted and authenticated channel.

Note To perform the installation, administrator privileges are required.

To start the installation process, download the Windows installer from [https://packages.wazuh.com/4.x/windows/wazuh-agent-4.9.0-1.msi](https://packages.wazuh.com/4.x/windows/wazuh-agent-4.9.0-1.msi)

Open PowerShell as Administrator and change directory to where Windows installer is located.

Run the following command

```python
.\wazuh-agent-4.9.0-1.msi /q WAZUH_MANAGER="10.0.0.20"
```

The installation process is now complete, and the Wazuh agent is successfully installed and configured. You can start the Wazuh agent from the GUI or by running:

```python
NET START Wazuh
```

Once started, the Wazuh agent will start the enrollment process and register with the manager.

### Troubleshooting Windows Wazuh Agent

If Wazuh agent on Windows is unable to connect to Wazuh server, open Wazuh Agent Manager

If Authentication key show as <insert_auth_key_here>, click Manage then Restart

Click Save then Refresh

![image.png](image%208.png)

You should be able to see Authentication key. The Authentication key is used to encrypt the traffic from the agent to the Wazuh server.

If issues still persist, refer to the log file located at `C:\Program Files (x86)\ossec-agent\ossec.log`

Alternatively, refer to the Troubleshooting guide from [https://documentation.wazuh.com/current/user-manual/agent/agent-enrollment/troubleshooting.html](https://documentation.wazuh.com/current/user-manual/agent/agent-enrollment/troubleshooting.html)

![image.png](image%209.png)

On Wazuh web UI, go to Server management, then Endpoints Summary.

Verify that the Windows agent is active.

![image.png](image%2010.png)

### Sysmon Integration

Perform the steps below to install and configure Sysmon on the Windows endpoint.

Download Sysmon from the [Microsoft Sysinternals page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/sysmon).

Download the Sysmon configuration file: [sysmonconfig.xml](https://wazuh.com/resources/blog/detecting-process-injection-with-wazuh/sysmonconfig.xml). Note this is a modified version of sysmonconfig.xml recommended for integration with Wazuh. 

Install Sysmon with the downloaded configuration file using PowerShell as an administrator:

```python
.\sysmon64.exe -accepteula -i .\sysmonconfig.xml
```

Open notepad as Administrator and open `ossec.conf`.

Add the following configuration within the `<ossec_config>` block to the Wazuh agent `C:\Program Files (x86)\ossec-agent\ossec.conf` file to specify the location to collect Sysmon logs:

```python
<localfile>
  <location>Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational</location>
  <log_format>eventchannel</log_format>
</localfile>
```

Restart the Wazuh agent to apply the changes by running the following PowerShell command as an administrator:

```python
Restart-Service -Name Wazuh
```

## **Monitoring network devices with Wazuh**

### Configure FortiGate to send syslog

Refer to the admin manual for specific details of configuration to send Reliable syslog using RFC 3195 format, a typical logging configuration will include the following features.

```python
config log syslogd setting 

set status enable
set server (syslog ip)
set source-ip (fortigate ip)
#Verify settings by running "show"
end 

config log memory filter
set forward-traffic enable
set local-traffic enable
set sniffer-traffic disable
set anomaly enable
set voip disable
set multicast-traffic enable
#Verify settings by running "show full-configuration"
end

config system global
set cli-audit-log enable
#Verify settings by running "show"
#Make sure timezone is correct e.g. "Pacific/Auckland"
end

config log setting
set neighbor-event enable
end
```

### Configure log rotation

By default, the `logrotate` service is configured to rotate logs in directories like `/var/log/`

For `rsyslog`, the rotation of its default log files (e.g., `/var/log/syslog`) is managed by the configuration file located at `/etc/logrotate.d/rsyslog`.
Open the /etc/logrotate.d/rsyslog file in a text editor:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/logrotate.d/rsyslog
```

Add the path to your `fortigate.log` file under the existing log files. 

```bash
/var/log/syslog

}
```

**Key Settings:**

- **rotate 4**: Keeps 4 log files before deleting the oldest one.
- **weekly**: Rotates logs once per week.
- **missingok**: If the log file is missing, no error will be raised.
- **notifempty**: Only rotates logs if they are not empty.
- **compress**: Compresses old log files (e.g., to `.gz`).
- **delaycompress**: Compresses the logs on the second rotation cycle, meaning the most recent rotated file is not compressed immediately.
- **sharedscripts**: Runs the `postrotate` script only once, even if multiple logs are rotated.
- **postrotate**: After log rotation, it runs `/usr/lib/rsyslog/rsyslog-rotate` to ensure that `rsyslog` reopens its log files (so it doesn't keep writing to the old rotated file).

### **Configuring syslog on the Wazuh server (optional)**

The **Wazuh server** can collect logs via syslog from endpoints such as firewalls, switches, routers, and other devices that don’t support the installation of Wazuh agents. More details can be found [here](https://documentation.wazuh.com/current/user-manual/capabilities/log-data-collection/syslog.html).

If you have a central logging server like Syslog or Logstash in place, you can install the Wazuh agent on that server to streamline log collection. This setup enables seamless forwarding of logs from multiple sources to the Wazuh server, facilitating comprehensive analysis.

### Configure Rsyslog on Ubuntu endpoint (recommended)

**Rsyslog** is a preinstalled utility in Ubuntu 22.04 for receiving syslog events. The following section shows the steps for enabling Rsyslog on the Ubuntu endpoint and configuring the Wazuh agent to send the syslog log data to the Wazuh server.

Edit /etc/rsyslog.conf. 

```jsx
nano /etc/rsyslog.conf
```

Uncomment udp/514. Add allowed sender and configure log file format.

Save changes.

```python
#provides UDP syslog reception
module(load=”imudp”)
input(type=”imudp” port=”514")

#Add allowed sender and configure log file format
$AllowedSender UDP, 10.0.0.1/24
$template remote-incoming-logs, "/var/log/%HOSTNAME%.log"
*.* ?remote-incoming-logs
```

Permit udp/514 through the firewall.

```python
sudo ufw allow 514/udp
```

Edit permissions on /var/log as Rsyslog may encounter permission error on relaunch. 

```python
sudo chmod 775 /var/log
```

Add any hosts you are receiving logs from to /etc/hosts

```python
sudo nano /etc/hosts
#Example
10.0.0.1    Fortigate
```

Restart and check status of rsyslog.

```python
sudo systemctl restart rsyslog
systemctl status rsyslog
```

Configure the syslog clients (network devices) to send logs to our syslog server

Check /var/log to see that new log files are updating.

```python
ls /var/log
cat fortigate.log
```

Example output

```bash
2024-09-13T08:13:46.806479+12:00 fortigate date=2024-09-12 time=15:44:50 devname="Fortigate" devid="FGVMEVUEOETC5XC8" eventtime=1726112689938988753 tz="+1200" logid="0001000014" type="traffic" subtype="local" level="notice" vd="root" srcip=192.168.1.64 srcport=14712 srcintf="root" srcintfrole="undefined" dstip=38.21.192.5 dstport=443 dstintf="port1" dstintfrole="wan" srccountry="Reserved" dstcountry="United States" sessionid=44992 proto=6 action="close" policyid=0 service="HTTPS" trandisp="noop" app="HTTPS" duration=1 sentbyte=441 rcvdbyte=223 sentpkt=5 rcvdpkt=4
```

### Install Wazuh agent on Ubuntu endpoint

Configure Firewall:

```bash
ufw allow 55000/tcp
ufw allow 1514/tcp
ufw allow 1515/tcp
```

Download Wazuh agent from the [packages list](https://documentation.wazuh.com/current/installation-guide/packages-list.html).

```jsx
wget https://packages.wazuh.com/4.x/apt/pool/main/w/wazuh-agent/wazuh-agent_4.9.0-1_amd64.deb
```

Transfer the Wazuh agent to Ubuntu endpoint.

Install the package using `dpkg`

```python
dpkg -i wazuh-agent_4.9.0-1_amd64.deb
```

After installing, set the Wazuh manager's IP address by editing the configuration file:

Look for the `<server>` section and update it with the Wazuh manager's IP address

```python
nano /var/ossec/etc/ossec.conf
```

```python
<ossec_config>
  <client>
    <server>
      **<address>10.0.0.20</address>**
      <port>1514</port>
      <protocol>tcp</protocol>
    </server>
    <config-profile>ubuntu, ubuntu22, ubuntu22.04</config-profile>
    <notify_time>10</notify_time>
    <time-reconnect>60</time-reconnect>
    <auto_restart>yes</auto_restart>
    <crypto_method>aes</crypto_method>
  </client>
```

Start and enable the Wazuh agent. Verify Wazuh agent is active and running.

```python
systemctl start wazuh-agent
systemctl enable wazuh-agent
systemctl status wazuh-agent
```

On Wazuh server UI, verify Ubuntu agent is active

![image.png](image%2011.png)

### Configure Wazuh to monitor Fortigate log

Add the following to /var/ossec/etc/ossec.conf file on Wazuh manager and agent

```python
#On both Wazuh manager and agent
<localfile>
  <log_format>syslog</log_format>
  <location>/var/log/fortigate.log</location>
</localfile>
```

Restart the manager and agent after adding this setting:

```python
systemctl restart wazuh-manager
systemctl restart wazuh-agent
```

Verify fortigate logs are being ingested.

**Follow the steps below to enable archiving and set up wazuh-archives-* index.**

Search wazuh-alerts-* and wazuh-archives-* index.

Add filter for location is /var/log/fortigate.log

![image.png](image%2012.png)

![image.png](image%2013.png)

### Default decoders and rules for FortiGate

By default, Wazuh has pre-installed decoders and rules for FortiGate. 

This can be checked in Wazuh server UI under Rules and Decoders

![image.png](image%2014.png)

![image.png](image%2015.png)

To test the default rule for FortiGate, SSH brute force attack was executed from Kali machine.

The alert from the rule “Fortigate: Multiple high traffic events from same source” was generated.

This can be verified in Threat Intelligent, Events section on the web UI.

## Event Logging

### **Log compression and rotation**

Log files can quickly accumulate and consume significant disk space in a system. To prevent this, the Wazuh manager compresses logs during its rotation process, helping to manage disk usage efficiently and maintain system performance. The Wazuh manager compresses log files daily or when they reach a certain threshold (file size, age, time, and more) and archives them. In the log rotation process, Wazuh creates a new log file with the original name to continuously write new events.

Log files are compressed daily and digitally signed using MD5, SHA1, and SHA256 hashing algorithms. The compressed log files are stored in the `/var/ossec/logs/` directory

### **Archiving event logs**

Events are logs generated by applications, endpoints, and network devices. The Wazuh server stores all events it receives, whether or not they trigger a rule. These events are stored in the Wazuh archives located at `/var/ossec/logs/archives/archives.log` and `/var/ossec/logs/archives/archives.json`. Security teams use archived logs to review historical data of security incidents, analyze trends, and generate reports to hunt threats.

By default, the Wazuh archives are disabled because it stores logs indefinitely on the Wazuh server. When enabled, the Wazuh manager creates archived files to store and retain security data for compliance and forensic purposes.

**Note:** The Wazuh archives retain logs collected from all monitored endpoints, therefore consuming significant storage resources on the Wazuh server over time. So, it is important to consider the impact on disk space and performance before enabling them.

### **Enabling archiving**

Edit the **Wazuh manager** configuration file `/var/ossec/etc/ossec.conf` and set the value of the highlighted fields below to `yes`:

```python
<ossec_config>
  <global>
    <jsonout_output>yes</jsonout_output>
    <alerts_log>yes</alerts_log>
    <logall>yes</logall>
    <logall_json>yes</logall_json>
</ossec_config>
```

`<logall>` enables or disables archiving of all log messages. When enabled, the Wazuh server stores the logs in a syslog format. The allowed values are `yes` and `no`.`<logall_json>` enables or disables logging of events. When enabled, the Wazuh server stores the events in a JSON format. The allowed values are `yes` and `no`.

Depending on the format you desire, you can set one or both values of the highlighted fields to `yes`. However, only the `<logall_json>yes</logall_json>` option allows you to create an index that can be used to visualize the events on the Wazuh dashboard.

Restart the Wazuh manager to apply the configuration changes:

```python
systemctl restart wazuh-manager
```

Depending on your chosen format, the file `archives.log`, `archives.json`, or both will be created in the `/var/ossec/logs/archives/` directory on the Wazuh server. Wazuh uses a default log rotation policy. It ensures that available disk space is conserved by rotating and compressing logs on a daily, monthly, and yearly basis.

### **Visualising the events on the dashboard**

Edit the Filebeat configuration file `/etc/filebeat/filebeat.yml` and change the value of `archives: enabled` from `false` to `true`:

```python
archives:
 enabled: true
```

Restart Filebeat to apply the configuration changes:

```python
systemctl restart filebeat
```

### **Wazuh dashboard**

Click the upper-left menu icon and navigate to **Dashboard** **management** > **Index patterns** > **Create index pattern**. Use `wazuh-archives-*` as the index pattern name, and set `timestamp` in the **Time field** drop-down list.

![image.png](image%2017.png)

![image.png](image%2018.png)

To view the events on the dashboard, click the upper-left menu icon and navigate to **Discover**. Change the index pattern to `wazuh-archives-*`.

![image.png](image%2019.png)

### **Use case: Detecting Signed Binary Proxy Execution**

Signed binary proxy execution is a technique threat actors use to bypass application whitelisting by using trusted binaries to run malicious code. This technique is identified as `T1218.010` based on the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

In this use case, we show how to abuse the Windows utility, `regsvr32.exe`, to bypass application controls. We then analyze events in the Wazuh archives to detect suspicious activity related to this technique.

### **Atomic Red Team installation**

Note: this has been tested in an isolated Unclassified environment. 

Perform the following steps to install the Atomic Red Team PowerShell module on a Windows endpoint using PowerShell as an administrator.

By default, PowerShell restricts the execution of running scripts. Run the command below to change the default execution policy to `RemoteSigned`:

```python
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
```

Install the ART execution framework:

Internet access has been enabled at this point

```python
IEX (IWR 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redcanaryco/invoke-atomicredteam/master/install-atomicredteam.ps1' -UseBasicParsing);
Install-AtomicRedTeam -getAtomics
```

Import the ART module to use `Invoke-AtomicTest` function

```python
Import-Module "C:\AtomicRedTeam\invoke-atomicredteam\Invoke-AtomicRedTeam.psd1" -Force
```

Use `Invoke-AtomicTest` function to show details of the technique `T1218.010`

```python
Invoke-AtomicTest T1218.010 -ShowDetailsBrief
```

```python
#Output
PathToAtomicsFolder = C:\AtomicRedTeam\atomics

T1218.010-1 Regsvr32 local COM scriptlet execution
T1218.010-2 Regsvr32 remote COM scriptlet execution
T1218.010-3 Regsvr32 local DLL execution
T1218.010-4 Regsvr32 Registering Non DLL
T1218.010-5 Regsvr32 Silent DLL Install Call DllRegisterServer
```

### **Attack emulation**

Emulate the signed binary proxy execution technique on the Windows endpoint.

Run the command below with Powershell as an administrator to perform the `T1218.010` test

```python
Invoke-AtomicTest T1218.010
```

```python
#Output
PathToAtomicsFolder = C:\AtomicRedTeam\atomics

Executing test: T1218.010-1 Regsvr32 local COM scriptlet execution
Done executing test: T1218.010-1 Regsvr32 local COM scriptlet execution
Executing test: T1218.010-2 Regsvr32 remote COM scriptlet execution
Done executing test: T1218.010-2 Regsvr32 remote COM scriptlet execution
Executing test: T1218.010-3 Regsvr32 local DLL execution
Done executing test: T1218.010-3 Regsvr32 local DLL execution
Executing test: T1218.010-4 Regsvr32 Registering Non DLL
Done executing test: T1218.010-4 Regsvr32 Registering Non DLL
Executing test: T1218.010-5 Regsvr32 Silent DLL Install Call DllRegisterServer
Done executing test: T1218.010-5 Regsvr32 Silent DLL Install Call DllRegisterServer
```

Several calculator instances will pop up after a successful execution of the exploit.

### Wazuh dashboard

Use the Wazuh archives to query and display events related to the technique being hunted. It's important to note that while consulting the archives, some events might already be captured as alerts on the Wazuh dashboard. You can use information from the Wazuh archives, including alerts and events that have no detection to create custom rules based on your specific requirements.

Apply a time range filter to view events that occurred within the last five minutes of when the test was performed. Filter to view logs from the specific Windows endpoint using `agent.id`, `agent.ip` or `agent.name`.

![image.png](image%2021.png)

There are multiple hits that you can investigate to determine a correlation with the earlier attack emulation. For instance, you may notice a calculator spawning event similar to the one observed on the Windows endpoint during the test.

![image.png](image%2022.png)

Type `regsvr32` in the search bar to streamline and investigate events related to the `regsvr32` utility.

![image.png](image%2023.png)

Expand any of the events to view their associated fields.

![image.png](image%2024.png)

Click on the JSON tab to view the JSON format of the archived logs.

![image.png](image%2025.png)

Apply the `data.win.eventdata.ruleName:technique_id=T1218.010,technique_name=Regsvr32` filter to see the technique ID as shown below.

![image.png](image%2026.png)

It is recommended to enable archiving as it allows users to view logs from network devices. However, if you prefer not to enable archiving, similar search can be performed on wazuh-alerts-* (default) index instead of wazuh-archives-* index.

Navigate to Home, then Overview on the web UI

Select number displayed on the Critical severity

![image.png](image%2027.png)

![image.png](image%2028.png)

Clear all filters then add the filter data.wineventda.image is C:\\Windows\\SYSWOW64\\regsvr32.exe

![image.png](image%2029.png)

### Troubleshooting Index Patterns

If search results displays the error icon and the message “No cached mapping for this field. Refresh field list from the index patterns page,” go to Dashboard Management, Index patterns and select each index. Click refresh button.

## **Detecting Suspicious Binaries (Testing Endpoint Security)**

Wazuh has anomaly and malware detection capabilities that detect suspicious binaries on an endpoint. Binaries are executable code written to perform automated tasks. Malicious actors use them mostly to carry out exploitation to avoid being detected.

In this use case, we demonstrate how the Wazuh rootcheck module can detect a trojan system binary on an Ubuntu endpoint. You perform the exploit by replacing the content of a legitimate binary with malicious code to trick the endpoint into running it as the legitimate binary.

The Wazuh rootcheck module also checks for hidden processes, ports, and files.

### **Configuration**

Take the following steps on the Ubuntu endpoint to enable the Wazuh rootcheck module and perform anomaly and malware detection.

By default, the Wazuh rootcheck module is enabled in the Wazuh agent configuration file. Check the `<rootcheck>` block in the `/var/ossec/etc/ossec.conf` configuration file of the monitored endpoint and make sure that it has the configuration below:

```python
<rootcheck>
    <disabled>no</disabled>
    <check_files>yes</check_files>

    <!-- Line for trojans detection -->
    <check_trojans>yes</check_trojans>

    <check_dev>yes</check_dev>
    <check_sys>yes</check_sys>
    <check_pids>yes</check_pids>
    <check_ports>yes</check_ports>
    <check_if>yes</check_if>

    <!-- Frequency that rootcheck is executed - every 12 hours -->
    <frequency>43200</frequency>
    <rootkit_files>/var/ossec/etc/shared/rootkit_files.txt</rootkit_files>
    <rootkit_trojans>/var/ossec/etc/shared/rootkit_trojans.txt</rootkit_trojans>
    <skip_nfs>yes</skip_nfs>
</rootcheck>
```

### **Attack emulation**

Create a copy of the original system binary:

```python
sudo cp -p /usr/bin/w /usr/bin/w.copy
```

Replace the original system binary `/usr/bin/w` with the following shell script:

```python
sudo tee /usr/bin/w << EOF
!/bin/bash
echo "`date` this is evil" > /tmp/trojan_created_file
echo 'test for /usr/bin/w trojaned file' >> /tmp/trojan_created_file
Now running original binary
/usr/bin/w.copy
EOF
```

The rootcheck scan runs every 12 hours by default. Force a scan by restarting the Wazuh agent to see the relevant alert:

```python
sudo systemctl restart wazuh-agent
```

### **Visualise the alerts**

You can visualise the alert data in the Wazuh dashboard. To do this, go to the **Threat Hunting** module and add the filters in the search bar to query the alerts.
`location:rootcheck AND rule.id:510`

![image.png](image%2032.png)

## **File Integrity Monitoring (Testing Endpoint Security)**

File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) helps in auditing sensitive files and meeting regulatory compliance requirements. Wazuh has an inbuilt FIM module that monitors file system changes to detect the creation, modification, and deletion of files.

### **Configuration on Ubuntu endpoint**

Edit the Wazuh agent `/var/ossec/etc/ossec.conf` configuration file. Add the directories for monitoring within the `<syscheck>` block. For this use case, you configure Wazuh to monitor the `/root` directory. 

```python
<directories check_all="yes" report_changes="yes" realtime="yes">/root</directories>
```

Restart the Wazuh agent to apply the configuration changes:

```python
sudo systemctl restart wazuh-agent
```

### **Test the configuration**

1. Create a text file in the monitored directory then wait for 5 seconds.
2. Add content to the text file and save it. Wait for 5 seconds.
3. Delete the text file from the monitored directory.

### **Visualise the alerts**

You can visualise the alert data in the Wazuh dashboard. To do this, go to the **File Integrity Monitoring** module and add the filters in the search bar to query the alerts:`rule.id: is one of 550,553,554`

![image.png](image%2033.png)

## **Vulnerability Detection (Testing Threat Intelligence)**

Wazuh uses the Vulnerability Detection module to identify vulnerabilities in applications and operating systems running on endpoints.

This use case shows how Wazuh detects unpatched Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) in the monitored endpoint.

### **Configuration**

The Vulnerability Detection module is enabled by default. You can perform the following steps on the Wazuh server to ensure that the Wazuh Vulnerability Detection module is enabled and properly configured.

Open the `/var/ossec/etc/ossec.conf` file on the Wazuh server. Check the following settings.
Vulnerability Detection is enabled:

```python
<vulnerability-detection>
   <enabled>yes</enabled>
   <index-status>yes</index-status>
   <feed-update-interval>60m</feed-update-interval>
</vulnerability-detection>
```

The indexer connection is properly configured.

By default, the indexer settings have one host configured. It's set to `0.0.0.0` as highlighted below.

```python
<indexer>
  <enabled>yes</enabled>
  <hosts>
    <host>https://0.0.0.0:9200</host>
  </hosts>
  <ssl>
    <certificate_authorities>
      <ca>/etc/filebeat/certs/root-ca.pem</ca>
    </certificate_authorities>
    <certificate>/etc/filebeat/certs/filebeat.pem</certificate>
    <key>/etc/filebeat/certs/filebeat-key.pem</key>
  </ssl>
</indexer>
```

Replace `0.0.0.0` with your Wazuh indexer node IP address or hostname. You can find this value in the Filebeat config file `/etc/filebeat/filebeat.yml`.

Ensure the Filebeat certificate and key name match the certificate files in `/etc/filebeat/certs`.

If you made changes to the configuration, restart the Wazuh manager.

```python
sudo systemctl restart wazuh-manager
```

### **Visualise the alerts**

You can visualise the detected vulnerabilities in the Wazuh dashboard. To see a list of active vulnerabilities, go to **Vulnerability Detection** and select **Inventory**.

## **Incident response**

The goal of incident response is to effectively handle a security incident and restore normal business operations as quickly as possible. As organizations’ digital assets continuously grow, managing incidents manually becomes increasingly challenging, hence the need for automation.

### **Wazuh Active Response module**

The Wazuh Active Response module allows users to run automated actions when incidents are detected on endpoints. This improves an organization's incident response processes, enabling security teams to take immediate and automated actions to counter detected threats.

### **Default active response actions**

Out-of-the-box scripts are available on every operating system that runs the Wazuh agents. Some of the default active response scripts include

| **Name of script** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| disable-account | Disables a user account |
| firewall-drop | Adds an IP address to the iptables deny list. |
| firewalld-drop | Adds an IP address to the firewalld drop list. |
| restart.sh | Restarts the Wazuh agent or server. |
| netsh.exe | Blocks an IP address using netsh. |

### **Custom active response actions**

One of the benefits of the Wazuh Active Response module is its adaptability. Wazuh allows security teams to create custom active response actions in any programming language, tailoring them to their specific needs.

### **Disabling User Account After a Brute-Force Attack (Testing Default Active Response)**

Account lockout is a security measure used to defend against brute force attacks by limiting the number of login attempts a user can make within a specified time. We use the Wazuh Active Response module to disable the user account whose password is being guessed by an attacker.

In the image below, the Wazuh Active Response module disables the account on a Linux endpoint and re-enables it again after 5 minutes.

After SSH Brute Force attack was launched from Kali machine, the login was disabled for 60 seconds because of 3 bad attempts

![image.png](image%2036.png)

## **Blocking a Known Malicious Actor (Testing Custom Active Response)**

In this use case, we demonstrate how to block malicious IP addresses from accessing web resources on a web server. 

### Configure Ubuntu endpoint

Update local packages and install the Apache web server:

```python
sudo apt update
sudo apt install apache2
```

If the firewall is enabled, modify the firewall to allow external access to web ports. Skip this step if the firewall is disabled:

```python
sudo ufw status
sudo ufw app list
sudo ufw allow 'Apache'
```

Check the status of the Apache service to verify that the web server is running:

```python
sudo systemctl status apache2
```

Use the `curl` command or open `http://<UBUNTU_IP>` in a browser to view the Apache landing page and verify the installation:

```python
curl http://<UBUNTU_IP>
```

Add the following to `/var/ossec/etc/ossec.conf` file to configure the Wazuh agent and monitor the Apache access logs:

```python
<localfile>
  <log_format>syslog</log_format>
  <location>/var/log/apache2/access.log</location>
</localfile>
```

Restart the Wazuh agent to apply the changes:

```python
sudo systemctl restart wazuh-agent
```

### **Configure the Wazuh server**

Download the utilities and configure the CDB list.

Download the Alienvault IP reputation database:

```python
sudo wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/firehol/blocklist-ipsets/master/alienvault_reputation.ipset -O /var/ossec/etc/lists/alienvault_reputation.ipset
```

Append the IP address of the attacker endpoint to the IP reputation database. Replace `<ATTACKER_IP>` with the Kali IP address in the command below:

```python
sudo echo "<ATTACKER_IP>" >> /var/ossec/etc/lists/alienvault_reputation.ipset
```

Download a script to convert from the `.ipset` format to the `.cdb` list format:

```python
sudo wget https://wazuh.com/resources/iplist-to-cdblist.py -O /tmp/iplist-to-cdblist.py
```

Convert the `alienvault_reputation.ipset` file to a `.cdb` format using the previously downloaded script:

```python
sudo /var/ossec/framework/python/bin/python3 /tmp/iplist-to-cdblist.py /var/ossec/etc/lists/alienvault_reputation.ipset /var/ossec/etc/lists/blacklist-alienvault
```

Assign the right permissions and ownership to the generated file:

```python
sudo chown wazuh:wazuh /var/ossec/etc/lists/blacklist-alienvault
```

### **Configure the active response module to block the malicious IP address**

Add a custom rule to trigger a Wazuh active response script. Do this in the Wazuh server `/var/ossec/etc/rules/local_rules.xml` custom ruleset file:

```python
<group name="attack,">
  <rule id="100100" level="10">
    <if_group>web|attack|attacks</if_group>
    <list field="srcip" lookup="address_match_key">etc/lists/blacklist-alienvault</list>
    <description>IP address found in AlienVault reputation database.</description>
  </rule>
</group>
```

Edit the Wazuh server `/var/ossec/etc/ossec.conf` configuration file and add the `etc/lists/blacklist-alienvault` list to the `<ruleset>` section:

```python
<ossec_config>
  <ruleset>
    <!-- Default ruleset -->
    <decoder_dir>ruleset/decoders</decoder_dir>
    <rule_dir>ruleset/rules</rule_dir>
    <rule_exclude>0215-policy_rules.xml</rule_exclude>
    <list>etc/lists/audit-keys</list>
    <list>etc/lists/amazon/aws-eventnames</list>
    <list>etc/lists/security-eventchannel</list>
    **<list>etc/lists/blacklist-alienvault</list>**

    <!-- User-defined ruleset -->
    <decoder_dir>etc/decoders</decoder_dir>
    <rule_dir>etc/rules</rule_dir>
  </ruleset>

</ossec_config>
```

Add the active response block to the Wazuh server `/var/ossec/etc/ossec.conf` file:

The `firewall-drop` command integrates with the Ubuntu local iptables firewall and drops incoming network connection from the attacker endpoint for 60 seconds:
Remember to uncomment the code block (remove `<!--` and `-->` )

```python
<ossec_config>
  <active-response>
    <command>firewall-drop</command>
    <location>local</location>
    <rules_id>100100</rules_id>
    <timeout>60</timeout>
  </active-response>
</ossec_config>
```

Restart the Wazuh manager to apply the changes:

```python
sudo systemctl restart wazuh-manager
```

### **Attack emulation**

Access any of the web servers from the Kali endpoint using the corresponding IP address. Replace `<WEBSERVER_IP>` with the appropriate value and execute the following command from the attacker endpoint:

```python
curl http://<WEBSERVER_IP>
```

The attacker endpoint connects to the victim's web servers the first time. After the first connection, the Wazuh active response module temporarily blocks any successive connection to the web servers for 60 seconds.

### **Visualise the alerts**

You can visualize the alert data in the Wazuh dashboard. To do this, go to the **Threat Hunting** module and add the filters in the search bar to query the alerts: `rule.id is one of 651, 100100`

## Network IDS integration

### Snort3

Install Wazuh agent on a Linux host where Snort3 is installed.

Edit Snort’s configuration 

```python
sudo nano /usr/local/etc/snort/snort.lua
```

Uncomment alert_full and add file=true

```python
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- 7. configure outputs
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- event logging
-- you can enable with defaults from the command line with -A <alert_type>
-- uncomment below to set non-default configs
--alert_csv = { }
--alert_fast = {file=true}
alert_full = {file=true}
--alert_sfsocket = { }
--alert_syslog = { }
--unified2 = { }
```

Edit the `/var/ossec/etc/ossec.conf` file of Wazuh agent and add the new `localfile` entry:
Make sure indentation is correct.

```python
<localfile>
  <log_format>snort-full</log_format>
  <location>/var/log/snort/alert_full.txt</location>
</localfile>
```

Restart the Wazuh agent

```python
systemctl restart wazuh-agent
```

Run Snort3 with the following parameter

```python
sudo snort -c /usr/local/etc/snort/snort.lua -i ens32 -A alert_full -l /var/log/snort
```

Note: Snort3 is currently configured to read local.rules for demonstration purposes.

Execute ping to 10.0.0.22 (Snort3 VM) from another host.

Verify alert_full.txt is generated

```python
root@Snort:/var/log/snort# ls
alert_fast.txt  alert_full.txt
```

On Wazuh dashboard, verify IDS Event alerts are generated and it points to alert_full.txt

### Suricata

Install Wazuh agent on a Linux host where Suricata is installed.

Changes the permissions of all files in the Suricata’s `/rules/` directories

```bash
sudo chmod 640 /var/lib/suricata/rules/*.rules
sudo chmod 640 /usr/share/suricata/rules/*.rules
```

Modify Suricata settings in the `/etc/suricata/suricata.yaml` file and set the following variables:

```bash
vars:
  # more specific is better for alert accuracy and performance
  address-groups:
    HOME_NET: "[10.0.0.0/24]"
...
community-id: true
...
af-packet:
    - interface: ens32
      cluster-id: 99
      cluster-type: cluster_flow
      defrag: yes
      use-mmap: yes
...
# Cross platform libpcap capture support
pcap:
  - interface: ens32
```

`interface` represents the network interface you want to monitor. Replace the value with the interface name of the Ubuntu endpoint. For example, `ens32` 

Restart the Suricata service:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart suricata
```

Add the following configuration to the `/var/ossec/etc/ossec.conf` file of the Wazuh agent. This allows the Wazuh agent to read the Suricata logs file:

```bash
<ossec_config>
  <localfile>
    <log_format>json</log_format>
    <location>/var/log/suricata/eve.json</location>
  </localfile>
</ossec_config>
```

Restart the Wazuh agent to apply the changes:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart wazuh-agent
```

### **Attack emulation**

Wazuh automatically parses data from `/var/log/suricata/eve.json` and generates related alerts on the Wazuh dashboard. From the Ubuntu host, run 

```bash
curl http://testmynids.org/uid/index.html
```

Expected response should be similar to:

```python
09/12/2024-13:51:32.520238  [**] [1:2100498:7] GPL ATTACK_RESPONSE id check returned root [**] [Classification: Potentially Bad Traffic] [Priority: 2] {TCP} 65.9.141.53:80 -> 10.0.0.25:34606Alerts:
```

Verify the results in Wazuh dashboard. Naviage to Threat Hunting > Suricata
