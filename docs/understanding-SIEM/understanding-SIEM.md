# Understanding SIEM

## Introduction

In today's digital landscape, cybersecurity is more important than ever. Protecting our organisation's information and systems from cyber threats is crucial to maintaining our operations, reputation, and trust with clients and partners. To enhance our defences, we are implementing Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) solutions, focusing on Splunk and Wazuh.
This document explains what SIEM is, why it's important, and how it affects different members of our organisation.

## What is SIEM?

Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) is a technology that provides real-time analysis of security alerts generated by applications and network hardware. SIEM systems collect and analyse security events from various sources within the IT infrastructure to detect anomalies, threats, and compliance issues, giving a centralised view of the organisation's security posture.

## Why SIEM Matters to Us

1. Proactive Threat Detection
      - Early Identification: SIEM enables us to detect potential security incidents before they escalate.
      - Real-Time Monitoring: Continuous surveillance helps us respond swiftly to threats.
2. Regulatory Compliance
      - Meeting Standards: SIEM assists in complying with military cybersecurity standards and other regulations.
      - Audit Trails: Maintains comprehensive logs necessary for audits and compliance reporting.
3. Risk Mitigation
      - Reducing Breaches: Consolidated security events help prevent breaches that could harm operations and reputation.
      - Strategic Decision-Making: Provides insights to inform cybersecurity investments and policies.

## Benefits of Implementing SIEM

- Enhanced Security: Strengthens defenses against sophisticated cyber threats.
- Operational Efficiency: Automates security monitoring, reducing manual efforts.
- Stakeholder Confidence: Demonstrates a commitment to security, bolstering trust.
- Cost Savings: Prevents costly breaches and downtime, safeguarding financial resources.

## How SIEM Works

1. Data Collection: Aggregates logs and events from servers, network devices, applications, and security tools.
2. Normalisation: Converts data into a consistent format for easier analysis.
3. Correlation: Uses rules and algorithms to link related events and identify patterns indicative of security incidents.
4. Alerting and Reporting: Generates real-time alerts and comprehensive reports for security teams.
