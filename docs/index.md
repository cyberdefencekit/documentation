# **Welcome to the Cyber Defence Kit**

## **Introduction**

The Cyber Defence Kit began as a personal exploration of open-source cybersecurity tools and grew into a shared learning resource. Each step was documented through proof-of-concept videos, notes, lessons learned, and practical tips, all shared openly to make these tools more accessible. The goal is to encourage others to explore, implement, and understand open-source cybersecurity solutions.
