## **What is Network Traffic Analysis?**

A **Network Traffic Analyser** is a tool that monitors, captures, and analyses network data to provide insights into network performance and security.

- **Network Traffic Analysis**: Involves examining network traffic patterns to detect anomalies, understand usage, and identify potential threats.

## **Why Network Traffic Analysis Matters to Us**

1. **Enhanced Visibility**
    - **Comprehensive Monitoring**: Provides a detailed view of all activities on our network.
    - **Anomaly Detection**: Identifies unusual patterns that may indicate security threats or performance issues.
2. **Improved Security**
    - **Threat Detection**: Helps in identifying malicious activities such as malware, unauthorised access, or data exfiltration.
    - **Incident Response**: Aids in investigating and responding to security incidents promptly.
3. **Performance Optimisation**
    - **Resource Management**: Monitors bandwidth usage to optimise network performance.
    - **Troubleshooting**: Assists in quickly identifying and resolving network issues affecting productivity.
4. **Regulatory Compliance**
    - **Audit Trails**: Maintains detailed logs required for compliance with industry regulations.
    - **Policy Enforcement**: Ensures adherence to organisational network usage policies.
